An adhukait cannot be flanked. Dance of Disaster (Su) Every time an adhukait deals damage with a melee attack, it can move an additional 10 feet and attack again, should it have additional attacks remaining. This ability functions similarly to the Spring Attack feat, but is limited not by how far the asura can move, only by its number of attacks. Thus an adhukait can move, attack, move, attack, and so on until it fails an attack roll or all six of its melee attacks are spent. Dual Minds (Su) Although an adhukait is a single creature, it possesses two minds. As such, adhukaits are allowed to make two saving throws to resist any mind-affecting effects. Should either of these saving throws succeed, the asura is not affected by the effect. Elusive Aura (Su) An adhukait constantly sheds an aura that blocks detection by magical scrying. All items and creatures within 30 feet of the asura, including itself, are treated as being under the effects of the spell nondetection. A caster must succeed at a DC 20 caster level check to overcome this effect.","The first adhukaits rose from the shattered bodies of two god-like brigands who, in a time forgotten to the multiverse, attempted to steal a great treasure from some ancient unnamed deity. The villains were caught in their crime and destroyed for their sin. Their destruction had unforeseen ramifications, however, as they shattered into 12 great pieces that fell upon the world, causing great quakes and tsunamis, killing thousands in an unpredicted catastrophe. As the dismembered corpses melted away, the first adhukaits crawled from their mangled ruins. The wily adhukaits revel in the pain of the innocent and the failures of deities. Adept thieves, kidnappers, and ambushers, these twisted, twin-like asuras delight in undermining goodly acts and stealing the relics of the divine, hiding away such treasures so none might find them. While their bodies appear as two fiends warped into an eternal, writhing embrace, adhukaits have but one personality, driven by hatred and sinister schemes. Knowing how their mangled bodies unnerve mortals, they delight in performing wild, deadly dances, bringing their victims low with their lethal, hell-forged blades. A typical adhukait stands just under 6 feet tall and, with the combined bulk of two fiends, weigh nearly 250 pounds. Habitat & Society Adhukaits make their homes throughout the hinterlands of Hell, favoring forgotten vaults of Erebus and lonely crags in Caina. Like most asuras, though, many find their ways to other planes and to mortal worlds, hiding in dark, secret places and fashioning terrible trophy halls for planed thefts and abductions. Proving easily contented upon taking a single captive or successfully performing an ideal heist, adhukaits typically retire to their grim redoubts, rarely straying far from their stolen spoils, keeping them eternally hidden under the shroud of their mysterious auras. Rarely do adhukaits work together, each fixating on selfish goals and glories they care not to share even with others of their kind. Only the will of a more powerful asura might convince them to put aside their blasphemous plottings, directing them toward the targets and coveted treasures of evils even greater than themselves. Known Adhukaits Several adhukaits eye Golarion in their schemes to spread hopelessness and disaster. While most work their evil among the faiths and faithful of Vudra, some target the realms of the Inner Sea for their blasphemy. Caiiac: Crowned with blue thorns, the adhukait Caiiac haunts the Voxfang, a bent spire twisting from the depths of Caina. At the peak of the spire languishes a crazed soul whose name has been long forgotten but who knows many blasphemous secrets of the goddess Shelyn's faith. The asura regularly crawls up from his lair within the spire's crevices to torment the soul, seeking ever more details on a heretical treasure the mad spirit claims lies at the seat of the ""Titan's Mind"" somewhere on Golarion. Kaisadvaisad: Having clawed additional grim crypts beneath the deepest catacombs of the Tomb of the Thousand Tusks, the asura Kaisadvaisad wheels and cackles over its decade-old victory. Deep below the defiled vault of bones and ivory lies the fiend's labyrinth cathedral, at the heart of which stands an altar crafted from a gigantic elephant skull. Within the cavity at the skull's center, smeared with deadly poison, lies a heavily trapped but entirely empty chest. Below the altar, however, hides a hollow wherein lies the ageless head of Shei Five Dawns, the lost oracle of Sinashakti. Kaisadvaisad gloats and revels daily over his gruesome prize, taking terrible delight in the knowledge that the followers of the empyreal lord still mourn and seek their lost prophet. Asuras A race of fiends populating the wilderness of Hell, asuras are terrible beings risen from the mistakes of the gods. Living blasphemies, each breed of asura traces its genesis to some godly misdeed or misstep, given form by divine power, mortal disillusionment, hatred, and bitterness. Among them rise the asura ranas, unique and terrible fiends like Aghasura, Daissiad, Holika, and Vritra, born from some of the most terrible divine accidents in the multiverse's unfathomable history. While asuras typically seek to bring the gods and their hosts low and to torment their worshipers, some have sought redemption. Such redeemed asuras make the lies of their cunning brethren all more believable yet dangerous, as the words of most asuras are poison and their intents ruinous. Asura Traits Asuras are lawful evil outsiders that make their homes amid Hell's wildernesses. Twisted beings, they are accidents of the gods, seeking to sow doubt among mortals and ultimately revenge themselves against the weak deities of good for their accursed existences. ΓÇó Immunity to curses, disease, poison. ΓÇó Resistance to acid 10 and electricity 10. ΓÇó Summon Asura (Su) Asuras share the ability to summon others of their kind, typically another of their type or a small number of less powerful asuras. ΓÇó Telepathy. ΓÇó Except where noted otherwise, asuras speak Infernal, Common, and Vudrani. ΓÇó An asura's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as lawful and evil for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.","<link rel=""stylesheet""href=""PF.css""><div><h2>Asura, Adhukait</h2><h3><i>Twin pallid fiends twist in a dance of daggers, brandishing deadly, crackling kukris that spark and flash as they spin between their warped bodies.

The asura regularly crawls up from his lair within the spire's crevices to torment the soul, seeking ever more details on a heretical treasure the mad spirit claims lies at the seat of the ""Titan's Mind"" somewhere on Golarion.</p><p><b>Kaisadvaisad:</b> Having clawed additional grim crypts beneath the deepest catacombs of the Tomb of the Thousand Tusks, the asura Kaisadvaisad wheels and cackles over its decade-old victory. Deep below the defiled vault of bones and ivory lies the fiend's labyrinth cathedral, at the heart of which stands an altar crafted from a gigantic elephant skull. Within the cavity at the skull's center, smeared with deadly poison, lies a heavily trapped but entirely empty chest.</p><p>Below the altar, however, hides a hollow wherein lies the ageless head of Shei Five Dawns, the lost oracle of Sinashakti. Kaisadvaisad gloats and revels daily over his gruesome prize, taking terrible delight in the knowledge that the followers of the empyreal lord still mourn and seek their lost prophet.</p><p><b>Asuras</b><br> A race of fiends populating the wilderness of Hell, asuras are terrible beings risen from the mistakes of the gods. Living blasphemies, each breed of asura traces its genesis to some godly misdeed or misstep, given form by divine power, mortal disillusionment, hatred, and bitterness. Among them rise the asura ranas, unique and terrible fiends like Aghasura, Daissiad, Holika, and Vritra, born from some of the most terrible divine accidents in the multiverse's unfathomable history. While asuras typically seek to bring the gods and their hosts low and to torment their worshipers, some have sought redemption. Such redeemed asuras make the lies of their cunning brethren all more believable yet dangerous, as the words of most asuras are poison and their intents ruinous.</p><p><b>Asura Traits</b><br> Asuras are lawful evil outsiders that make their homes amid Hell's wildernesses.

All creatures within 5 feet take 1d6 points of fire damage at the beginning of the dragon's turn. An old dragon's aura extends to 10 feet. An ancient dragon's damage increases to 2d6. Incinerate (Su) A great wyrm red dragon can incinerate creatures in its fiery breath. A creature reduced to fewer than 0 hit points by its breath weapon must make a Fortitude save (using the breath weapon's DC). Failure indicates that the creature is reduced to ash. Creatures destroyed in this way can only be restored to life through true resurrection or similar magic. Manipulate Flames (Su) An old or older red dragon can control any fire spell within 10 feet per age category of the dragon as a standard action. This ability allows it to move any fire effect in the area, as if it were the caster. This ability also allows it to reposition a stationary fire effect, although the new placement must be one allowed by the spell. Finally, for 1 round following the use of this ability, the dragon can control any new fire spell cast within its area of control, as if it were the caster. It can make all decisions allowed to the caster, including canceling the spell if it so desires. Melt Stone (Su) An ancient or older red dragon can use its breath weapon to melt rock at a range of 100 feet, affecting a 5-foot-radius area per age category. The area becomes lava to a depth of 1 foot. Any creature in contact with the lava takes 20d6 points of fire damage on the first round, 10d6 on the second, and none thereafter as the lava hardens and cools. If used on a wall or ceiling, treat this ability as an avalanche that deals fire damage.

All creatures within 5 feet take 1d6 points of fire damage at the beginning of the dragon's turn. An old dragon's aura extends to 10 feet. An ancient dragon's damage increases to 2d6. </h5><h5><b>Incinerate (Su)</b> A great wyrm red dragon can incinerate creatures in its fiery breath. A creature reduced to fewer than 0 hit points by its breath weapon must make a Fortitude save (using the breath weapon's DC). Failure indicates that the creature is reduced to ash. Creatures destroyed in this way can only be restored to life through true resurrection or similar magic. </h5><h5><b>Manipulate Flames (Su)</b> An old or older red dragon can control any fire spell within 10 feet per age category of the dragon as a standard action. This ability allows it to move any fire effect in the area, as if it were the caster. This ability also allows it to reposition a stationary fire effect, although the new placement must be one allowed by the spell. Finally, for 1 round following the use of this ability, the dragon can control any new fire spell cast within its area of control, as if it were the caster. It can make all decisions allowed to the caster, including canceling the spell if it so desires. </h5><h5><b>Melt Stone (Su)</b> An ancient or older red dragon can use its breath weapon to melt rock at a range of 100 feet, affecting a 5-foot-radius area per age category. The area becomes lava to a depth of 1 foot. Any creature in contact with the lava takes 20d6 points of fire damage on the first round, 10d6 on the second, and none thereafter as the lava hardens and cools. If used on a wall or ceiling, treat this ability as an avalanche that deals fire damage.</h5><h5><b> Smoke Vision (Ex)</b> A very young red dragon can see perfectly in smoky conditions (such as those created by pyrotechnics).</h5><h5><b> Spell-Like Abilities (Sp)</b> A red dragon gains the following spell-like abilities, usable at will upon reaching the listed age category.

This creates heavy snow conditions in a 50-foot radius for 1 minute, centered on the dragon. This snow slows movement (4 squares of movement per square entered) and limits vision as fog does. Cold Aura (Su) An adult white dragon radiates an aura of cold. All creatures within 5 feet of the dragon take 1d6 points of cold damage at the beginning of the dragon's turn. An old dragon's aura extends to 10 feet. An ancient dragon's damage increases to 2d6. Freezing Fog (Sp) An old white dragon can use this ability three times per day. It is similar to an acid fog spell but deals cold damage instead of acid damage. It also causes a rime of slippery ice to form on any surface the fog touches, creating the effect of a grease spell. The dragon is immune to the grease effect because of its icewalking ability. This ability is the equivalent of a 6th-level spell. Ice Shape (Su) A young white dragon can shape ice and snow at will.

Ice Tomb (Sp) A great wyrm can, as a standard action, cause a creature to sink into ice. This works as imprisonment, but only while the target is touching an icy surface. A white dragon can use this ability once per day (CL equals dragon's HD). Targets entombed by this ability can be freed by casting freedom or by physically freeing the creature from the ice (Hardness 0, 360 hit points). The save DC is Charisma-based.

As a full-round action, an advodaza can touch a willing adjacent creature, marking it with a unique symbol similar to an arcane mark. This symbol can be either visible or invisible, as the devil chooses. For as long as the target possesses the mark, it gains a spell-like ability it can use once per day. This spell-like ability comes from the advodaza's chosen domain (see the false divinity ability). The target also gains the ability to telepathically communicate with the advodaza over any distance as long as the two creatures are on the same plane. An advodaza can mark multiple creatures, up to an amount equaling its Hit Dice (typically 18). An advodaza can dispel its mark as a standard action, no matter where the bearer is. It can also, as a standard action, deal pain to a mark bearer that causes 6d6 points of damage with no saving throw.  An advodaza's mark cannot be removed physically, but a dispel magic or erase spell that succeeds on a dispel check or caster level check of DC 30 removes the effect.  False Divinity (Su) Advodazas possess areas of concern as deities do, but on a far smaller scale. Each advodaza chooses one cleric domain and gains the domain spells (up to 5th level) of that domain as spell-like abilities, each of which it can use 3 times per day. The advodaza does not gain any of the domain's granted powers. Most advodazas possess powers from the Evil, Fire, Law, War, or Weather domains, though any domain is possible.  Evil Domain: align weapon (evil only), dispel good, magic circle against good, protection from good, unholy blight Fire Domain: burning hands, fire shield, fireball, produce flame, wall of fire Law Domain: align weapon (law only), dispel chaos, magic circle against chaos, order's wrath, protection from chaos War Domain: divine power, flame strike, magic vestment, magic weapon, spiritual weapon Weather Domain: call lightning, fog cloud, ice storm, obscuring mist, sleet storm Idol Armor (Su) Advodazas armor themselves in their fallen idols and ornaments of devotion. This armor grants an advodaza a +6 armor bonus to AC and immunity to cold, electricity, and sonic damage, as well as immunity to the spell dismissal. The spells chaos hammer, holy smite, holy word, and word of chaos destroy this armor, removing the devil's armor bonus to AC and immunities (its cold immunity decreases to its normal resistance 10). If uninterrupted for 1 hour, an advodaza can summon new armor to replace its destroyed protection.  Infernal Wound (Su) The damage an advodaza deals with its claws causes persistent wounds that deal 2d6 points of bleed damage. Bleeding caused in this way is di#cult to stanch-a DC 30 Heal check stops the damage, and any attempt to heal a creature suffering from an infernal wound must succeed on a DC 30 caster level check or the spell does not function. Success indicates the healing works normally and stops all bleed effects.  The Heal check and caster level DC are Constitution-based.","False gods, fallen demagogues, nemesis devils-the fiends known collectively as advodazas survive from dark ages past, when mortals offered worship to base things and unwholesome spirits masqueraded as baleful gods. Although time and faith have turned against these beings, the most tenacious of their kind have refused to fade into oblivion, and to these obstinate corruptors and one-time deities the gates of Hell swing wide and welcoming. These lords of cults and masters of forgotten mysteries find renewed vigor in the depths of the Pit, and those seeking to renew their power and lordship over mortalkind undergo terrible indoctrinations and binding rites that transform them over the ages into true devils. What emerge are eidolons of half-remembered demigods, fallen princes seeking to claim their subjects anew, devils of faith, and fiends of blasphemy- the idol-clad advodazas.  No two advodazas look exactly alike, each embodying the powers and concerns that saw it worshiped in ages past and subsequently anthropomorphized as a monstrous being. Typically, this results in quadrupedal, half-bestial shapes bristling with terrible wings, hooves, claws, and fangs. Universally, though, they bear the broken remnants of their fallen faith, usually in the form of cracked idols worn like armor, profane talismans crafted into jewelry, or fearful totems wielded like massive weapons. Despite their range of appearances, all advodazas possess the same core abilities, though some particularly ancient or powerful fiends possess unique abilities. Most advodazas stand 18 feet tall and weigh nearly 9 tons.  Ecology Fantastically old beings, advodazas rose from spirits worshiped by mortals in distant ages. While humanoids still huddled in crude shelters, begging any power that would listen for protection from storms, beasts, enemies, hunger, and countless other fears, the spirits of the land, sky, and animals were the first to give heed. Not deities, but elusive influences, these forces heard these early prayers and worked what appeared to be miracles in return for sacrifices and adoration. Slowly, these formless vestiges took shape as idols, fetishes, palladiums, and all manner of cult images. Yet, as knowledge of true deities and the powers they offered worshipers spread, the old spirits were forgotten or demonized and rooted out. While most simply faded into the ethers of time, the bitterest demi-deities of countless worlds found their way to Hell and Asmodeus, who welcomed them and offered them a chance for renewed power and worship, as well as a chance to avenge themselves against the deities and mortals who had snubbed them. Honing their hatreds through ages of flame, these beings emerged from the Pit as advodazas. One of the few breeds of devilkind not forged wholly by Hell itself, advodazas prove exceedingly rare compared to other fiends.  Habitat & Society All advodazas seek to return to the Material Plane, where they might tempt new followers to serve, sacrifice, and raise idols to their names. While merciless, advodazas appeal to many mortal servants due to the directness of their interaction and their willingness to grant power or violently smite enemies for a seemingly paltry price. In death, however, their servants find no divine realm nor glory seated beside some grand deity. For when they die, there is only Hell.","<link rel=""stylesheet""href=""PF.css""><div><h2>DEVIL, ADVODAZA </h2><h3><i>The rending, thunderous clangor of rushing claws heralds the charge of this fire-eyed ruin, a terror of flame-seared hide and saber-like spines shaped in a monstrously muscled centauric form.

This acid pool has a radius of 5 feet per age category of the dragon. When an acid pool is created, anyone inside its area takes an amount of damage equal to the dragon's breath weapon (Reflex half). Any creature that starts its turn touching this pool takes damage, but can make a Reflex save for half.

The ability spoils liquids containing water. Liquid-based magic items (such as potions) and items in a creature's possession must succeed on a Will save (DC equal to the dragon's frightful presence) or become ruined. This ability is the equivalent of a 1st-level spell. Its range is equal to that of the dragon's frightful presence. Speak with Reptiles (Sp) A young or older black dragon gains the constant spell-like ability to speak with reptiles. This functions as speak with animals, but only with reptilian animals. Spell-Like Abilities (Sp) A black dragon gains the following spell-like abilities, usable at will upon reaching the listed age category. Juvenile-darkness (radius 10 feet per age category); Old-plant growth; Ancient-insect plague. Swamp Stride (Ex) A very young or older black dragon can move through bogs and quicksand without penalty at its normal speed.

This acid pool has a radius of 5 feet per age category of the dragon. When an acid pool is created, anyone inside its area takes an amount of damage equal to the dragon's breath weapon (Reflex half). Any creature that starts its turn touching this pool takes damage, but can make a Reflex save for half.

The acid pool floats on water, and deals damage to anything on the surface. </h5><h5><b>Acidic Bite (Su)</b> At old age, a black dragon's bite deals an additional 2d6 points of acid damage. An ancient dragon's damage increases to 4d6, and a great wrym's to 6d6.</h5><h5><b> Charm Reptiles (Sp)</b> A great wyrm black dragon can use this ability three times per day.

This ability is the equivalent of a 1st-level spell. Its range is equal to that of the dragon's frightful presence.</h5><h5><b> Speak with Reptiles (Sp)</b> A young or older black dragon gains the constant spell-like ability to speak with reptiles. This functions as speak with animals, but only with reptilian animals.</h5><h5><b> Spell-Like Abilities (Sp)</b> A black dragon gains the following spell-like abilities, usable at will upon reaching the listed age category. Juvenile-darkness (radius 10 feet per age category); Old-plant growth; Ancient-insect plague.</h5><h5><b> Swamp Stride (Ex)</b> A very young or older black dragon can move through bogs and quicksand without penalty at its normal speed.

Cold Aura (Su) An adult white dragon radiates an aura of cold. All creatures within 5 feet of the dragon take 1d6 points of cold damage at the beginning of the dragon's turn. An old dragon's aura extends to 10 feet. An ancient dragon's damage increases to 2d6. Freezing Fog (Sp) An old white dragon can use this ability three times per day. It is similar to an acid fog spell but deals cold damage instead of acid damage. It also causes a rime of slippery ice to form on any surface the fog touches, creating the effect of a grease spell. The dragon is immune to the grease effect because of its icewalking ability. This ability is the equivalent of a 6th-level spell. Ice Shape (Su) A young white dragon can shape ice and snow at will. This ability functions as stone shape, but only targeting ice and snow, not stone. A white dragon's caster level for this effect is equal to its Hit Dice. Ice Tomb (Sp) A great wyrm can, as a standard action, cause a creature to sink into ice. This works as imprisonment, but only while the target is touching an icy surface. A white dragon can use this ability once per day (CL equals dragon's HD). Targets entombed by this ability can be freed by casting freedom or by physically freeing the creature from the ice (Hardness 0, 360 hit points). The save DC is Charisma-based. Icewalking (Ex) This ability works like the spider climb spell, but the surfaces the dragon climbs must be icy. The dragon can move across icy surfaces without penalty and does not need to make Acrobatics checks to run or charge on ice. Snow Vision (Ex) A very young white dragon learns to see perfectly well in snowy conditions. A white dragon does not suffer any penalties to Perception checks while in snow. Spell-Like Abilities (Sp) A white dragon gains the following spell-like abilities usable at will upon reaching the listed age category. Juvenile-fog cloud; Young adult-gust of wind; Ancient-wall of ice; Great wyrm-control weather.

These horse-sized burrowing monsters generally avoid heavily settled areas like cities, but their predilection for livestock and humanoid f lesh ensures that they do not keep to the deep wilderness either. Their preferred habitat is rural farmlands, as the loose soil of such regions makes it easy for the creatures to burrow. Tales speak of larger ankhegs that dwell in remote deserts- such creatures likely feed primarily on giant scorpions and camels, and rarely come in contact with civilization due to their remote locations. (A desert ankheg is a Huge advanced ankheg.) In combat, an ankheg prefers to attack with its bite.  Against multiple foes, an ankheg often grabs one of the available targets and then attempts to retreat to safety, burrowing into the ground.

Ankhegs burrow with their legs and mandibles, moving with unsettling speed through loose soil, sand, gravel, and the like-they cannot burrow through solid stone. Burrowing ankhegs can construct tunnels by pausing frequently to shore up the walls with a thicker, less caustic secretion from their mouths. If an ankheg chooses to make a permanent tunnel when burrowing, it moves at half speed. A typical ankheg tunnel is 10 feet tall and wide, roughly circular in cross-section, and from 60 to 150 feet long ([1d10 + 5] x 10). Clusters of ankhegs often share the same territory and create intricate winding networks of tunnels under farmlands, sometimes resulting in sinkholes where too many burrow at once.

Instead, there hovers only a plain mask, an unnatural facade devoid of all empathy, emotion, or mercy.",Devil,Book of the Dammed V1,0,"Boundless Reach (Su) A deimavigga's claws slice through reality, allowing it to make melee attacks against any creature it is aware of-typically meaning creatures within 100 feet. The devil still only threatens the 10-foot area around it and it cannot make attacks of opportunity against creatures farther away. This ability can span vast distances, allowing a deimavigga making use of divination magic to detect distant creatures and attack foes separated by miles or even planes. Spells like forbiddance, which prevent planar travel, also protect against a deimavigga's claws. The spell dimensional anchor also prevents a deimavigga from using this ability for the duration of that spell. An attacked creature can retaliate that round, striking at the devil's claws with weapons or spells as if its entire body were present, but cannot grapple or otherwise prevent the claws from vanishing out of reach at the end of the round. Evangelization (Su) The words of deimaviggas are poison to the mind. Every round a deimavigga speaks (a free action), all non-devils with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher within 30 feet must make a DC 28 Will save or become vulnerable to its blasphemous discourse. The DC of this Will save increases by +1 for each consecutive round a creature has listened to the same deimavigga speak. Creatures must be listening to a deimavigga to be affected by its oration. Deafened creatures and those in combat-either with the deimavigga or other creatures-are not considered to be listening. Victims cannot simply declare they are not listening without taking steps to impede their hearing. Upon failing this save, a victim can be affected by the heretical power of a deimavigga's words. The devil may use its speech to affect a listener in ways that mimic any of the following spells: calm emotions (DC 21), charm monster (DC 23), command (DC 20), confusion (DC 23), crushing despair (DC 23), deep slumber (DC 22), enthrall (DC 21), modify memory (DC 23), rage (DC 22), or suggestion (DC 22). Victims still receive saving throws against these spell effects, but if they fail their saves they are not aware the devil is working its power upon them. A deimavigga can affect multiple victims with different spell effects in the same round. A creature that makes its save against this ability is immune to that particular devil's evangelization for the next 24 hours. This is a sonic mind-affecting effect. The base save DC is Charisma-based. Indomitable Oration (Su) A deimavigga's speech is always perfectly clear and cannot be silenced or warped. In areas of incredible noise, through water or airless voids, even in areas of magical silence, these devil's voices can still be heard normally. All beings understand deimaviggas, as if these devils constantly spoke in all tongues at once. Malleable Form (Su) A deimavigga has complete control over its physical form, and if transformed into another shape against its will, it can revert to its own form as a free action. Ohrwurm (Ex) As a standard action, three times per day, a deimavigga can whisper a fundamental and terrifying multiversal truth to one creature within 5 feet. The target must make a DC 28 Will save or have the devil's words take root in its psyche. Outsiders and elementals have a +2 bonus on their saves to resist this ability. Initially, the deimavigga's words seem to have no effect. Anytime the victim tries to rest, though, he must make an additional DC 28 Will save or be affected as per the spell nightmare (even if the victim doesn't technically sleep). After a night of suffering vivid dreams and wrestling with the devil's words, the victim must make yet another DC 28 Will save or have its alignment shift one step toward lawful evil. Only by unlearning what the deimavigga told it can a victim be free of this effect, requiring a spell such as miracle, modify memory, or wish. Summon Devil (Sp) Once per day a deimavigga can attempt to summon 1d6 osyluths or 2d4 barbazu with a 50% chance of success, or 1 gelugon with a 20% chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of an 8th-level spell. Wisdom Drain (Su) A deimavigga drains 1d6 points of Wisdom each time it hits with its claw attack. (A deimavigga does not heal any damage when it uses its Wisdom drain.)","Regal, fearsome, and unfeeling, deimaviggas seek to turn the faithful from their gods, using cold logic to proselytize the path of atheism, the freedom of the mortal spirit, and the order offered by Hell. Their slowly ever-shifting masks speak envenomed words and imply the hollow nature of their lies. Speaking out against all deities-except for Asmodeus, whom they subtly tout as a bringer of discipline even as they downplay his divinity-these deadly intellectuals know that those who turn from their deities are more likely to succumb to the temptations of their diabolical brethren. Rather than attempting to sway the souls of individual mortals, these cunning fiends take on the roles of prophets of reason, disguising themselves beneath layers of illusion to evangelize the virtues and freedoms of lives unshackled from demanding deities. Occasionally one might focus its arguments on a soul of particular piety, delighting in throwing deities' most devoted servants into endless crises of faith. Deimaviggas care little for what gods their depredations affect, disenfranchising the worshipers of the divine and the profane alike. In their natural shapes, deimaviggas stand 7 feet tall and weigh a mere 120 pounds. When disguised, though, they typically take the forms of wise old men, priests who have ""realized their folly,"" and even ""angels"" of truth. Habitat & Society Deimaviggas prefer to spend their time upon the Material Plane, swaying the weak and corruptible souls of mortals. There they seek out either vast mortal cities, where their heresy might reach many ears, or small communities where the isolated might fall to their blasphemous philosophizing. When in Hell, though, they linger in Caina, tormenting the souls of those trapped upon its lonely islands, developing and testing complicated and often confusing arguments. Preferring to operate alone, these poison-tongued devils rarely work with others of their kind, even though their status as greater devils affords them great control over their lesser brethren. They find their arguments benefit from simplicity, their endeavors complicated by even the most obedient minions. Pit fiends and infernal dukes sometimes utilize deimaviggas as spies and spreaders of dissension and confusion, though even among devilkind these enigmatic fiends are considered strange and unnerving.","<link rel=""stylesheet""href=""PF.css""><div><h2>Devil, Apostate</h2><h3><i>Armored in the ceremonial garb of some grim knight, this figure stands unnaturally still, though the intricate metalwork patterns of its sculpted mantle writhe and shift as if alive.

A creature that makes its save against this ability is immune to that particular devil's evangelization for the next 24 hours. This is a sonic mind-affecting effect. The base save DC is Charisma-based. </h5><h5><b>Indomitable Oration (Su)</b> A deimavigga's speech is always perfectly clear and cannot be silenced or warped. In areas of incredible noise, through water or airless voids, even in areas of magical silence, these devil's voices can still be heard normally. All beings understand deimaviggas, as if these devils constantly spoke in all tongues at once. </h5><h5><b>Malleable Form (Su)</b> A deimavigga has complete control over its physical form, and if transformed into another shape against its will, it can revert to its own form as a free action.</h5><h5><b> Ohrwurm (Ex)</b> As a standard action, three times per day, a deimavigga can whisper a fundamental and terrifying multiversal truth to one creature within 5 feet. The target must make a DC 28 Will save or have the devil's words take root in its psyche. Outsiders and elementals have a +2 bonus on their saves to resist this ability. Initially, the deimavigga's words seem to have no effect. Anytime the victim tries to rest, though, he must make an additional DC 28 Will save or be affected as per the spell nightmare (even if the victim doesn't technically sleep). After a night of suffering vivid dreams and wrestling with the devil's words, the victim must make yet another DC 28 Will save or have its alignment shift one step toward lawful evil. Only by unlearning what the deimavigga told it can a victim be free of this effect, requiring a spell such as miracle, modify memory, or wish.</h5><h5><b> Summon Devil (Sp)</b> Once per day a deimavigga can attempt to summon 1d6 osyluths or 2d4 barbazu with a 50% chance of success, or 1 gelugon with a 20% chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of an 8th-level spell. </h5><h5><b>Wisdom Drain (Su)</b> A deimavigga drains 1d6 points of Wisdom each time it hits with its claw attack. (A deimavigga does not heal any damage when it uses its Wisdom drain.)</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p>Regal, fearsome, and unfeeling, deimaviggas seek to turn the faithful from their gods, using cold logic to proselytize the path of atheism, the freedom of the mortal spirit, and the order offered by Hell. Their slowly ever-shifting masks speak envenomed words and imply the hollow nature of their lies. Speaking out against all deities-except for Asmodeus, whom they subtly tout as a bringer of discipline even as they downplay his divinity-these deadly intellectuals know that those who turn from their deities are more likely to succumb to the temptations of their diabolical brethren.</p><p>Rather than attempting to sway the souls of individual mortals, these cunning fiends take on the roles of prophets of reason, disguising themselves beneath layers of illusion to evangelize the virtues and freedoms of lives unshackled from demanding deities. Occasionally one might focus its arguments on a soul of particular piety, delighting in throwing deities' most devoted servants into endless crises of faith. Deimaviggas care little for what gods their depredations affect, disenfranchising the worshipers of the divine and the profane alike.</p><p>In their natural shapes, deimaviggas stand 7 feet tall and weigh a mere 120 pounds. When disguised, though, they typically take the forms of wise old men, priests who have ""realized their folly,"" and even ""angels"" of truth.</p><p><b>Habitat & Society</b><br> Deimaviggas prefer to spend their time upon the Material Plane, swaying the weak and corruptible souls of mortals.</p><p>There they seek out either vast mortal cities, where their heresy might reach many ears, or small communities where the isolated might fall to their blasphemous philosophizing.</p><p>When in Hell, though, they linger in Caina, tormenting the souls of those trapped upon its lonely islands, developing and testing complicated and often confusing arguments.</p><p>Preferring to operate alone, these poison-tongued devils rarely work with others of their kind, even though their status as greater devils affords them great control over their lesser brethren. They find their arguments benefit from simplicity, their endeavors complicated by even the most obedient minions. Pit fiends and infernal dukes sometimes utilize deimaviggas as spies and spreaders of dissension and confusion, though even among devilkind these enigmatic fiends are considered strange and unnerving.</p></h4></div>",NULL,,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL

The DC the aspidochelone must exceed is 25, or the result of the boat captain's Profession (sailor) check, whichever is higher. Captivating Scent (Ex) An aspidochelone exudes intoxicating pheromones from its skin, causing nearby creatures to seek it out. Anyone within a 1-mile radius must succeed on a DC 12 Will save or feel inexplicably drawn toward the aspidochelone by the most direct route possible. This effect is not an overwhelming compulsion, but more a subtle suggestion. The save DC is Charisma-based with a -10 penalty. Deep Sea Denizen (Ex) An aspidochelone can travel to extraordinary depths, and has adapted to the intense darkness and water pressure of the deep. It possesses darkvision with a range of 120 ft. and is immune to damage from water pressure. Hibernate (Ex) After gorging itself on innumerable tons of deep sea life and unfortunate travelers, an aspidochelone floats to the surface and goes into a deep hibernation with only its mottled back jutting from the waves. While hibernating, it appears to be little more than a rocky outcropping or, in the cases of the largest aspidochelone, an entire island. A hibernating aspidochelone is considered to have taken 20 on its Stealth check to hide in plain sight as a rock or island. An aspidochelone rouses from its hibernation for one of two reasons: hunger or disturbance. After entering its hibernation, a aspidochelone sleeps for 2d10x10 years, rousing naturally after this time has elapsed. An aspidochelone about to awaken usually sleeps fitfully for the last year of its rest, quivering with tremors that feel like earthquakes to creatures upon it. These tremors are treated as a minor version of the earthquake spell that affects the entire island, forcing creatures on the ground to make a DC 29 Reflex save to avoid falling down and causing 30 points of damage to all structures. An aspidochelone might be awakened immediately if it takes 100 or more points of damage in a single day. If awakened in this manner, an aspidochelone typically dives to escape its attacker, then rises again to consume it. The save DC is Constituiton-based. Hibernation of Ages (Ex) An aspidochelone in hibernation continues to exude its captivating scent. Over time, birds attracted by the aspidochelone's pheromones come to roost on the whale, inadvertently bringing the seeds of small plants and shrubbery to grow in the cracks upon the aspidochelone's thick hide. The preponderance of plants, seabirds, and even other beasts gives the creature the appearance of a rocky but natural island. Thus, any aspidochelone who has spent more than 10 years hibernating gains an addition +10 bonus on its Stealth check to look like a natural island. Watery Grave (Ex) A startled aspidochelone descends rapidly into the depths of the sea, creating an undertow in the water that pulls creatures above the whale down with it. Anyone standing on or swimming within 100 feet of the aspidochelone when it dives must make a DC 29 Reflex save or take 10d6 points of damage from the crushing waves and pressure, and be pulled 100 feet below the water. Even if a creature escapes the undertow, the water within 100 feet of a passing aspidochelone is treated as rough water, requiring a DC 20 Swim check to move at half speed. The save DC is Constitution-based.","A legendary creature of the sea, aspidochelones are eldritch whales of titanic size. When floating near the surface of the water, aspidochelones have frequently been mistaken by desperate sailors for small islands due to the craggy, mottled flesh of their steeply humped backs. Yet, upon tethering their boats to the whale's tough hide and lighting a fire to ward off the cold, many castaways discover to their horror that the spur of land they have beached upon is in fact an enormous creature. This realization comes too late for many unfortunate souls as the creature plunges beneath the waves, dragging trespassers down with it. An aspidochelone appears to be a huge whale with an extraordinarily thick, rock-like hide. From tail to snout, the creature generally measures more than 500 feet in length, and weighs upward of 100,000 tons. Few ever see an aspidochelone for what it actually is, however, having only glimpsed the pitted and uneven skin of its topside. As seabirds and other creatures come to rest upon the hibernating creature, they carry with them plant seeds and dirt. Over time, the accumulated plants and wildlife gives an aspidochelone the appearance of a small, densely inhabited island. Ecology Aspidochelones universally live in the deep ocean, as only such large bodies of water can sustain their enormous appetites. Fortunately for seafaring civilizations that rely upon fishing and sea trade for their livelihoods, the gigantic whales are rarely seen. Thought by many to be creatures of myth, the incredibly long-lived aspidochelones spend most of their adult lives in extended periods of hibernation. The creatures possess sluggish metabolisms, allowing them to remain dormant for decades at a time as they slowly consume the fat built up during previous feeding frenzies. As they float near the surface of the water, drifting with the oceanic currents, the whales are frequently mistaken for small islands. Even while hibernating, aspidochelones exude an intoxicating pheromone, causing birds and animals such as sea lions to seek them out. While the huge numbers of creatures rarely cause the beasts to rouse from their slumber, foolhardy human explorers or would-be settlers often startle them out of their reveries when they mistake the creatures' skin for rock or clay. Even when provoked by humans, aspidochelones seldom remain awake unless stirred by their ferocious hunger. When they waken, the whales are wracked by terrible hunger pangs and rampage about the oceans, seeking tons of prey to consume before sinking into their torpor once again. An aspidochelone is a terror during its feeding season, rightfully feared by seagoing civilizations as a monster of the deep come to devour the world. When feeding, the whales consume vast quantities of food, devouring schools of fish, large sea creatures, and sailing vessels alike. Such immense consumption of sea life frequently devastates local ecosystems, wiping out all food sources for dozens of leagues in every direction. Habitat & Society Aspidochelones do not possess any society to speak of, as they spend most of their time floating aimlessly about the ocean. When two aspidochelones of the opposite gender encounter one another, however, each creature is roused from its hibernation by the other's pheromones. From these unions only one aspidochelone is ever born, and the whales spend 6 months raising the calf to maturity. Once the calf becomes full-grown, the aspidochelones part ways, never to see one another again. Among island cultures, a number of myths have sprung up around the creatures. Legends speak of how an irresistible smell lures sailors to remote islands, only to have the entire ship and crew devoured by the titanic whales in a single gulp. A few outlandish myths even claim that the creatures have devoured entire islands, while pirate tales tell of fantastic treasure buried within the hides of beasts like island. Many of these cultures regard aspidochelones as gods of the sea that call men to their deaths.","<link rel=""stylesheet""href=""PF.css""><div><h2>Aspidochelone</h2><h3><i>The ground shudders and the seabirds take to wing with piercing cries of alarm.

The save DC is Constitution-based.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p>A legendary creature of the sea, aspidochelones are eldritch whales of titanic size. When floating near the surface of the water, aspidochelones have frequently been mistaken by desperate sailors for small islands due to the craggy, mottled flesh of their steeply humped backs.</p><p>Yet, upon tethering their boats to the whale's tough hide and lighting a fire to ward off the cold, many castaways discover to their horror that the spur of land they have beached upon is in fact an enormous creature. This realization comes too late for many unfortunate souls as the creature plunges beneath the waves, dragging trespassers down with it.</p><p>An aspidochelone appears to be a huge whale with an extraordinarily thick, rock-like hide. From tail to snout, the creature generally measures more than 500 feet in length, and weighs upward of 100,000 tons. Few ever see an aspidochelone for what it actually is, however, having only glimpsed the pitted and uneven skin of its topside.</p><p>As seabirds and other creatures come to rest upon the hibernating creature, they carry with them plant seeds and dirt. Over time, the accumulated plants and wildlife gives an aspidochelone the appearance of a small, densely inhabited island.</p><p><b>Ecology</b><br> Aspidochelones universally live in the deep ocean, as only such large bodies of water can sustain their enormous appetites. Fortunately for seafaring civilizations that rely upon fishing and sea trade for their livelihoods, the gigantic whales are rarely seen.</p><p>Thought by many to be creatures of myth, the incredibly long-lived aspidochelones spend most of their adult lives in extended periods of hibernation. The creatures possess sluggish metabolisms, allowing them to remain dormant for decades at a time as they slowly consume the fat built up during previous feeding frenzies. As they float near the surface of the water, drifting with the oceanic currents, the whales are frequently mistaken for small islands. Even while hibernating, aspidochelones exude an intoxicating pheromone, causing birds and animals such as sea lions to seek them out. While the huge numbers of creatures rarely cause the beasts to rouse from their slumber, foolhardy human explorers or would-be settlers often startle them out of their reveries when they mistake the creatures' skin for rock or clay.</p><p>Even when provoked by humans, aspidochelones seldom remain awake unless stirred by their ferocious hunger.</p><p>When they waken, the whales are wracked by terrible hunger pangs and rampage about the oceans, seeking tons of prey to consume before sinking into their torpor once again. An aspidochelone is a terror during its feeding season, rightfully feared by seagoing civilizations as a monster of the deep come to devour the world. When feeding, the whales consume vast quantities of food, devouring schools of fish, large sea creatures, and sailing vessels alike. Such immense consumption of sea life frequently devastates local ecosystems, wiping out all food sources for dozens of leagues in every direction.</p><p><b>Habitat & Society</b><br> Aspidochelones do not possess any society to speak of, as they spend most of their time floating aimlessly about the ocean. When two aspidochelones of the opposite gender encounter one another, however, each creature is roused from its hibernation by the other's pheromones. From these unions only one aspidochelone is ever born, and the whales spend 6 months raising the calf to maturity. Once the calf becomes full-grown, the aspidochelones part ways, never to see one another again.</p><p>Among island cultures, a number of myths have sprung up around the creatures. Legends speak of how an irresistible smell lures sailors to remote islands, only to have the entire ship and crew devoured by the titanic whales in a single gulp. A few outlandish myths even claim that the creatures have devoured entire islands, while pirate tales tell of fantastic treasure buried within the hides of beasts like island. Many of these cultures regard aspidochelones as gods of the sea that call men to their deaths.</p></h4></div>",NULL,,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL

Feared for their boldness and territorial natures, these giant birds are also known to be eminently tameable, proving useful guardians, hunters, and even steeds when kept well fed. Axe beaks are relatively social creatures, forming small groups in which both males and females hunt together. They nest in immense mounds made of sticks, branches, leaves, and whatever else they can scavenge (including the bones and equipment of previous meals), with each nest used by a large group of axe beaks. Females typically lay clutches of 1d4+1 eggs once per year, which the parents take turns keeping warm for 2 months. At the end of this period, the axe beaks break hatchlings out of their shells. These young are fed by their parents for 2 more months before they begin hunting on their own. Mature axe beaks stand 7 feet tall and weigh as much as 500 pounds. Most live to be up to 50 years old. Numerous species of axe beaks exist, their colors and general build varying wildly from region to region. Dull brown and gray breeds are most common, but bright yellow, blue, black, and more exotic plumages have also been documented. Training an Axe Beak An axe beak requires training before it will bear a rider. Taming an axe beak requires 6 weeks of work and a DC 25 Handle Animal check, after which it can be taught tricks as normal. Riding an axe beak requires an exotic saddle. Axe beak eggs are worth 1,000 gp apiece on the open market, while young are worth 1,500 gp each.

The save DC is Constitution-based. Entangle (Ex) If a balor strikes a Medium or smaller foe with its whip, the balor can immediately attempt a grapple check without provoking an attack of opportunity. If the balor wins the check, it draws the foe into an adjacent square. The foe gains the grappled condition, but the balor does not. Flaming Body (Su) A balor's body is covered in dancing flames. Anyone striking a balor with a natural weapon or unarmed strike takes 1d6 points of fire damage. A creature that grapples a balor or is grappled by one takes 6d6 points of fire damage each round the grapple persists. Vorpal Strike (Su) Any slashing weapon a balor wields (including its standard longsword and whip) gains the vorpal weapon quality. Weapons retain this quality for one hour after the balor releases the weapon, but after this the weapon reverts to its standard magical qualities, if any. Whip Mastery (Ex) A balor treats a whip as a light weapon for the purposes of two-weapon fighting, and can inflict lethal damage on a foe regardless of the foe's armor.","When folk whisper frightened tales of the demonic, what most envision is a towering figure of fire and flesh, a horned nightmare armed with flaming whip and sword flying through the night in search of its latest victim. The demon these folk fear is the balor, and that fear is justly placed, for few demons can match the mighty balor in strength or brutality. On the Abyss, most balors serve demon lords as generals or captains (those balors who don't are even more potent, and are known as balor lords-see below). A balor typically commands vast legions of demons, and while it often lets these slavering and eager minions fight its battles, the balor is far from a coward. If presented with an opportunity to join a fight, few balors choose to resist. In combat, a balor relies upon its spell-like abilities to fight foes wise enough to avoid melee range, favoring destructive powers like fire storm or implosion and saving dominate monster for use against the rare foe it would prefer to capture alive. A balor usually uses telekinesis to disarm ranged weapons or pull foes into melee-with the use of a quickened telekinesis, a balor can use the latter tactic and still inf lict a full-round attack on a hapless foe. A balor reduced to fewer than 50 hit points almost always seeks to flee via teleportation, but if that and flight prove impossible it seeks to position itself such that, if it is slain, its death throes are as devastating as possible to the enemy host. A balor stands 14 feet in height and weighs 4,500 pounds. Only the cruelest mortal souls can fuel the creation of a balor-unlike in the cases of most other demons, it often takes multiple souls of powerful villains to trigger the birthing of a new balor. Balor Lords Even more terrible than the typical balor are those who do not call a demon lord their master, but instead are masters themselves. A balor lord typically rules over a region no larger than half the size of the realm in which it resides (as only full demon lords can command the rule of an entire Abyssal realm), and even though most balor lords rule much smaller regions (generally areas comparable in size to a single continent), their power is vast indeed. A balor lord is typically a CR 21 to CR 25 monster (a range shared with the various unique nascent demon lords, with the range of CR 26 and above being the domain of the demon lords themselves), and as such serves quite well as the final villain in a long-running campaign. The majority of balor lords have several levels of barbarian, fighter, or ranger (although ranger balor lords never form bonds with animals), but some instead have levels of bard, rogue, sorcerer, or wizard. Cleric balor lords are unknown, as they see themselves as objects of worship, not the other way around, although rumors persist of powerful balor clerics that directly serve demon lords or even evil gods. In addition to any benefits a balor lord might gain from its class levels, all balor lords possess one additional unique ability over and above those granted by its race and class. Listed here are three sample balor lord abilities, but these samples are by no means the entirety of the strange powers a balor lord might wield. Lifedrinker (Su) Whenever the balor lord slays a living foe, it receives the benefits of a heal spell (CL 20th). This ability can activate up to once per round. Master of Magic (Su) The balor lord has additional spell-like abilities (20 spell levels' worth of 1st-4th level spells usable at will and 20 spell levels' worth of 5th-8th level spells usable 3 times a day). Soul Swallow (Su) As a standard action, the balor lord can inhale the soul of a living creature within 30 feet. The target must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 balor lord's racial HD + the balor lord's Charisma modifier) or die. The body of a humanoid creature killed in this manner immediately transforms into a demon under the balor lord's command (a babau, succubus, or shadow demon, according to the balor lord's whim).","<link rel=""stylesheet""href=""PF.css""><div><h2>Demon, Balor </h2><h3><i>This winged fiend's horned head and fanged visage present the perfection of the demonic form, fire spurting from its flesh.</i></h3><br></br></div><div class=""heading""><p class=""alignleft"">Balor</p><p class=""alignright"">CR 20</p><div style=""clear: both;""></div></div><div><h5><b>XP </b>307,200</h5><h5>CE Large outsider (chaotic, demon, evil, extraplanar)</h5><h5><b>Init </b>+11; <b>Senses </b>darkvision 60 ft., low-light vision, true seeing; Perception +38</h5><h5><b>Aura </b>flaming body, unholy aura (DC 26)</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>DEFENSE</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>AC </b>36, touch 20, flat-footed 29 (+4 deflection, +7 Dex, +16 natural, -1 size)</h5><h5><b>hp </b>370 (20d10+260)</h5><h5><b>Fort </b>+29, <b>Ref </b>+17, <b>Will </b>+25</h5><h5><b>DR </b>15/cold iron and good; <b>Immune </b>electricity, fire, poison; <b>Resist </b>acid 10, cold 10; <b>SR </b>31</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>OFFENSE</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Spd </b>40 ft., fly 90 ft.

This horror can only be seen by each individual onlooker, with even Basileus being unaware of what his viewers see. Those within 30 feet of Basileus must make a DC 25 Will save. Those with 6 or fewer Hit Dice who fail instantly die from fear, while those with 6 or more Hit Dice are panicked and take 6d6 points of damage. Those who save are immune to Basileus's death or panic effects, but still take damage. Those who remain within 30 feet of Basileus, even after making their saves, take 6d6 points of damage every round as long as Basileus continues to take standard actions to maintain the terror. The death and panic aspects of this ability are a mind-affecting fear effect, with even creatures immune to such effects still being affected by the ability's damage. The save DC is Charisma-based. Terror Shape (Su) While making use of his terror ability, Basileus can manifest one to five additional, monstrous limbs. These take on terrible appearances dictated by the terror ability, and deal 2d6+8 damage. When Basileus ceases the use of terror, these additional natural weapons vanish. Veil of Forms (Su) Basileus appears as a powerful and attractive member of the same race as any creature looking upon him. His appearance is always appealing, with subtle illusory alterations that differ from viewer to viewer. Basileus is not aware of the specifics of his appearance to other creatures, though he may alter specifics as per the spell alter self. This is an illusion that is in effect anytime he is not using his terror ability, and grants him a +8 racial modifier on Diplomacy and Intimidate checks. Should a creature be able to see past the illusion, Basileus does not gain this racial modifier on opposed checks against that creature.","An infernal paradox at once wondrous and terrifying, tempting and blasphemous, the entity called the Son of Suns, Prince of Paradises, Jadros Voax, Baphon, Vexsoul, or simply Basileus serves as the herald of Asmodeus and harbinger of Hell's will. Few who have faced the messenger of the Archfiend survive the experience unchanged, for he is the very word of Hell. Typically appearing as a youth of stunning beauty and of the same race as those who look upon him-even when appearing before those of multiple races-little in the herald's comely appearance, finery, or proud bearing sets him apart from the vainglorious princes of countless mortal nations. In his radiant eyes, though, dance hellfire flames and a hint of the power he bears himself and often offers. To encounter Basileus is to know the interest or ire of the lord of Hell himself. Like his master, the herald knows no love for mortalkind, striving only to fulfill the worlds-spanning master schemes of the Prince of Darkness and draw souls into the grip of Hell by the legion. As such, he most often serves as an envoy between Asmodeus and other deities and extraplanar figures of note, rarely deigning to set foot upon the raucous and uncouth Material Plane. When his master's will dictates he travel to the mortal realm, though, his words bear all the weight of Hell, and typically offer temptations few souls can hope to refuse. Occasionally his master bids him answer the summons of the few mortals who hold the Prince of Darkness's favor, but even these forays typically prove subtle steps toward some greater infernal goal. In his humanoid form, Basileus appears as a 6-foottall mortal of surprising but unnatural beauty, with a languid voice like warm wine over silk. Although typically of male gender, this is not always the case, though he always appears before his lord in masculine form. Much of his form is an illusion, though, and a highly subjective illusion at that. Those who can see past Basileus's shrouds of innate deception find a human-like figure resembling the idealized form he presents, though still appearing somehow hollow. The most daring and ancient fiends have suggested that Basileus bears a resemblance to Baalzebul before Asmodeus punished the archdevil by stripping him of his angelic appearance-a rumor that leads the lord of the seventh to loathe his master's herald even more than he despises most creatures. A Thousand Terrors Through the millennia, dozens of immortal beings have served as heralds of the Prince of Darkness-even Baalzebul holding this position for a time before his cursed advancement to archdevil. Yet without fail, each herald has eventually overstepped his bounds and garnered Asmodeus's disfavor, facing a quiet, ignominious, and likely torturous end within Nesus's depths. Yet even after his past heralds' march of disappointments, Asmodeus holds Basileus as the most perfect of all his emissaries, for rather than elevating the messenger from among the ranks of his diabolical legions, the lord of Hell personally crafted his servant to meet his every expectation. An infernal automaton of sorts, Hell's herald is a being zealously devoted to the Prince of Darkness, even beyond the allegiances of devilkind, archdevils, or the Pit itself. Many among Hell's infernal hierarchy have whispered of their lord's herald's true nature, suggesting that he is a terrible amalgam, drawn from the painwracked nightmares of the Archfiend's past emissaries; a being shaped from the deepest proto-stuff of Hell itself; or even a vaporous being distilled from a measure of Hell's collective suffering. Regardless, the ever-changing physical nature of Asmodeus's herald and his unwavering loyalty to his master are widely known throughout the planes and beyond. On the Material Plane, Basileus has become a legend in his own right. Although rarely visiting the worlds of the mortal realm, wherever he treads he takes the form of the greatest terror of the age. Such leads to highly varied reports of the herald's form and nature, even among Asmodeus's worshipers, and the confusion and apprehension seem to please both Basileus and his master greatly. Among the Prince of Darkness's enemies, Basileus is a thousand horrors known by a thousand names. Tales of his appearance across Golarion have granted him a dozen terrible names: the Bleeding Oliphaunt, Baphon Reborn, and the Seventh Spawn being among those most often heard in fearful whispers. Each of these titles and countless more have been recorded by scholars of the divine outside the church of Asmodeus, with such disparities, though inaccurate, still capturing the deceit inherent in the herald's form and a measure of the horror that is Basileus.","<link rel=""stylesheet""href=""PF.css""><div><h2>Basileus</h2><h3><i>This comely young man is clad in fine silken robes and gold thread, with hair the color of sunbeams.

Those who remain within 30 feet of Basileus, even after making their saves, take 6d6 points of damage every round as long as Basileus continues to take standard actions to maintain the terror. The death and panic aspects of this ability are a mind-affecting fear effect, with even creatures immune to such effects still being affected by the ability's damage. The save DC is Charisma-based. </h5><h5><b>Terror Shape (Su)</b> While making use of his terror ability, Basileus can manifest one to five additional, monstrous limbs. These take on terrible appearances dictated by the terror ability, and deal 2d6+8 damage. When Basileus ceases the use of terror, these additional natural weapons vanish. </h5><h5><b>Veil of Forms (Su)</b> Basileus appears as a powerful and attractive member of the same race as any creature looking upon him. His appearance is always appealing, with subtle illusory alterations that differ from viewer to viewer. Basileus is not aware of the specifics of his appearance to other creatures, though he may alter specifics as per the spell alter self. This is an illusion that is in effect anytime he is not using his terror ability, and grants him a +8 racial modifier on Diplomacy and Intimidate checks. Should a creature be able to see past the illusion, Basileus does not gain this racial modifier on opposed checks against that creature.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>An infernal paradox at once wondrous and terrifying, tempting and blasphemous, the entity called the Son of Suns, Prince of Paradises, Jadros Voax, Baphon, Vexsoul, or simply Basileus serves as the herald of Asmodeus and harbinger of Hell's will. Few who have faced the messenger of the Archfiend survive the experience unchanged, for he is the very word of Hell. Typically appearing as a youth of stunning beauty and of the same race as those who look upon him-even when appearing before those of multiple races-little in the herald's comely appearance, finery, or proud bearing sets him apart from the vainglorious princes of countless mortal nations. In his radiant eyes, though, dance hellfire flames and a hint of the power he bears himself and often offers. To encounter Basileus is to know the interest or ire of the lord of Hell himself. Like his master, the herald knows no love for mortalkind, striving only to fulfill the worlds-spanning master schemes of the Prince of Darkness and draw souls into the grip of Hell by the legion. As such, he most often serves as an envoy between Asmodeus and other deities and extraplanar figures of note, rarely deigning to set foot upon the raucous and uncouth Material Plane. When his master's will dictates he travel to the mortal realm, though, his words bear all the weight of Hell, and typically offer temptations few souls can hope to refuse. Occasionally his master bids him answer the summons of the few mortals who hold the Prince of Darkness's favor, but even these forays typically prove subtle steps toward some greater infernal goal.</p><p>In his humanoid form, Basileus appears as a 6-foottall mortal of surprising but unnatural beauty, with a languid voice like warm wine over silk. Although typically of male gender, this is not always the case, though he always appears before his lord in masculine form. Much of his form is an illusion, though, and a highly subjective illusion at that. Those who can see past Basileus's shrouds of innate deception find a human-like figure resembling the idealized form he presents, though still appearing somehow hollow. The most daring and ancient fiends have suggested that Basileus bears a resemblance to Baalzebul before Asmodeus punished the archdevil by stripping him of his angelic appearance-a rumor that leads the lord of the seventh to loathe his master's herald even more than he despises most creatures.</p><p><b>A Thousand Terrors</b><br> Through the millennia, dozens of immortal beings have served as heralds of the Prince of Darkness-even Baalzebul holding this position for a time before his cursed advancement to archdevil. Yet without fail, each herald has eventually overstepped his bounds and garnered Asmodeus's disfavor, facing a quiet, ignominious, and likely torturous end within Nesus's depths.</p><p>Yet even after his past heralds' march of disappointments, Asmodeus holds Basileus as the most perfect of all his emissaries, for rather than elevating the messenger from among the ranks of his diabolical legions, the lord of Hell personally crafted his servant to meet his every expectation. An infernal automaton of sorts, Hell's herald is a being zealously devoted to the Prince of Darkness, even beyond the allegiances of devilkind, archdevils, or the Pit itself. Many among Hell's infernal hierarchy have whispered of their lord's herald's true nature, suggesting that he is a terrible amalgam, drawn from the painwracked nightmares of the Archfiend's past emissaries; a being shaped from the deepest proto-stuff of Hell itself; or even a vaporous being distilled from a measure of Hell's collective suffering. Regardless, the ever-changing physical nature of Asmodeus's herald and his unwavering loyalty to his master are widely known throughout the planes and beyond.</p><p>On the Material Plane, Basileus has become a legend in his own right. Although rarely visiting the worlds of the mortal realm, wherever he treads he takes the form of the greatest terror of the age. Such leads to highly varied reports of the herald's form and nature, even among Asmodeus's worshipers, and the confusion and apprehension seem to please both Basileus and his master greatly. Among the Prince of Darkness's enemies, Basileus is a thousand horrors known by a thousand names. Tales of his appearance across Golarion have granted him a dozen terrible names: the Bleeding Oliphaunt, Baphon Reborn, and the Seventh Spawn being among those most often heard in fearful whispers. Each of these titles and countless more have been recorded by scholars of the divine outside the church of Asmodeus, with such disparities, though inaccurate, still capturing the deceit inherent in the herald's form and a measure of the horror that is Basileus.</p></h4></div>",NULL,,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,NULL

Basilisks live in nearly any terrestrial environment, from forest to desert, and their hides tend to match and ref lect their surroundings-a desert-dwelling basilisk might be tan or brown, while one that lives in a forest could be bright green. They tend to make their lairs in caves, burrows, or other sheltered areas, and these dens are often marked by statues of people and animals in lifelike poses-the petrified remains of those unfortunate enough to stumble across the basilisk.  Basilisks have the ability to consume the creatures they petrify, their churning stomach acid dissolving and extracting nutrients from the stone, but the process is slow and inefficient, making them lazy and sluggish. As a result, basilisks rarely stalk prey or chase those who avoid their gaze, counting on their stealth and the element of surprise to keep them safe and fed. When not lying in wait for the small mammals, birds, and reptiles that normally make up their diet, basilisks spend their time sleeping in their lairs, and those brave enough to capture basilisks or hide treasure near them find that they make natural guardians and watchdogs.  An adult basilisk is 13 feet long, with fully half of that made up by its long tail, and weighs 300 pounds. Some breeds have short, curved horns on their noses or small crests of bony growths topping their heads like crowns.  Though normally solitary creatures, coming together only to mate and lay eggs, in particularly dangerous areas small groups may band together for protection and attack intruders en masse.  For unknown reasons, weasels and ferrets are immune to the basilisk's stare, and sometimes sneak into basilisk lairs while a parent is hunting in order to consume its young.

Against creatures with the demon type, its natural weapons are also treated as cold iron and good.  </h5><h5><b>Rot (Su)</b> A bebilith's bite causes a horrible withering and weakening of the flesh, resulting in a hideous melting and foul rotting effect. This catastrophic withering begins on the round the creature is bitten and continues for another 4 rounds thereafter, for 5 rounds of withering in all. Each round the rot persists, the target must succeed on a DC 23 Fortitude save or take 2 points of Constitution damage.

It takes a DC 20 Perception check to notice it before it attacks. Demolishing Attack (Ex) A ravener behemoth that makes a full attack against an object or structure deals double damage. Mighty Roar (Su) Every 1d4 rounds, as a standard action, a ravener behemoth can issue a mighty roar in a 60-foot cone that duplicates the effects of greater shout. This attack deals 10d6 points of sonic damage (or 20d6 against exposed brittle or crystalline objects or crystalline creatures). It also causes creatures to be stunned for 1 round and deafened for 4d6 rounds. Creatures exposed to the sonic attack can negate the stunning and halve both the damage and duration of the deafness with a successful Fortitude save (DC 30). The save DC is Constitution-based. Rock Hurling (Ex) Because of their immense hunger, ravener behemoths often ingest ore-laced rocks to fill their stomachs with longer-lasting sustenance. When faced with dangerous opponents outside its reach, a behemoth may regurgitate these rocks and grind them into smaller shards with its hardened teeth. It then spits forth these shards one at a time as boulders weighing between 60 to 80 pounds. A ravener usually carries enough rocks in its stomachs to make up to 4d6 boulders in this manner. Shock Wave (Ex) As a full-round action, a ravener behemoth can hammer the ground with its feet and generate a localized tremor that rips the ground, knocking down smaller creatures and creating di#cult terrain in a 100-foot radius centered on the behemoth. This shock wave lasts for 1 round, during which time creatures in the affected area cannot move or attack. They must also succeed on a DC 38 Reflex save or fall prone. Any spellcaster on the ground must make a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level) or lose any spell he or she tries to cast. The save DC is Strength-based. Swallow Whole (Ex) A ravener behemoth can swallow a snatched opponent of Huge size or smaller with its bite attack by making a successful grapple check. Once swallowed, a victim suffers 4d6+24 points of bludgeoning damage per round from one of the behemoth's 5 stomachs. A swallowed creature can cut its way out by using a light slashing or piercing weapon to deal 33 points of damage to a stomach (AC 27). Once the creature exits, that stomach regenerates 15 hit points per round. A ravener behemoth may gorge itself upon multiple creatures, shunting each victim to a different stomach each time. Each of a behemoth's 5 stomachs can hold 1 Huge, 4 Large, 16 Medium, 64 Small, 256 Tiny, or over 1,000 Diminutive or smaller creatures.","Ravener behemoths walk the land as the ultimate consumers of all things. This includes every manner of beast, plant, and mineral caught in their path. They indiscriminately fill their five ever-hungry stomachs by cutting wide swaths through tangled jungles, digging through mountains for precious ores, and razing settlements and strongholds to get at those sheltering inside. Sometimes they even ply shallow coastal waters, capsizing ships to feast upon their crews and any other predators drawn by the smell of blood in the water. Monstrously massive, a ravener behemoth stands nearly 60 feet tall on four thick, trunk-like legs and measures up to 80 feet long. Multiple horns and tusks sprout from its face and head, helping it root through even the hardest soil and rocks in search of food. It quickly reduces anything stronger into rubble with its earth-shattering roar and stomping feet. A rocky hide grown from the many minerals it routinely consumes protects it from harm even as lichen, small plants, and trees take root along its back, out of reach of its ravenous mouth. Divine blessings bequeathed by the gods ensure only the most powerful spells or adamantine weapons can lay a behemoth low. As a result, the ravener behemoth fears nothing and eats everything. Ecology Behemoths have existed since the birth of the First World, where they served the gods as work beasts, intelligently shaping and transforming the land to a divine plan. However, when such work ended, some gods sought to put down their creations, hunting them to near-extinction. Others simply forgot them or left them to die as the First World faded away. But many behemoths stubbornly refused to abandon their life's purpose and crossed into the greater world, migrating in an effort to stay close to their creators. Unfortunately, as part of the journey, or because they lost the divine sponsorship of the gods, many behemoths devolved, losing their sentience and becoming nothing more than monstrous animals and creatures of legend. The ravener behemoth exists as one such example. Driven mad by the inattention of the gods and filled with anger over their abandonment, the raveners found a new purpose. Desperately hungry, these multi-stomached behemoths wholly devoted themselves to feasting upon the bounty of all the gods had created, gorging themselves in an effort to fill the void left by their masters and attract the gods' attention once again. Unfortunately, because of their lowered intelligence, most raveners can no longer answer when such attention finally comes, lacking the will or ability to communicate with their creators, and consumed by an all-encompassing hunger instead. The gods mostly leave such behemoths alone, ashamed and reluctant to fully extinguish their enduring spirits. More often, the gods challenge their mortal champions by directing them to deal with such creatures in their stead. Habitat & Society Most ravener behemoths live solitary lives, as their insatiable appetites cause too much strain on a single ecosystem to support more of their kind. Inevitably, when their paths do cross, two possible outcomes emerge. The beasts either do battle to establish dominance over one another, or every 50 years, certain hormones in female raveners can invoke a natural mating instinct between the behemoths instead. A pregnant ravener may produce up to 1d3 offspring per mating cycle, but it then drives off its mate to ensure enough food remains in the area to raise each cub to young adulthood. Raveners may live up to 1,000 years while food sources remain, and frequently migrate when famine strikes. Behemoths of Legend Some ancient raveners retain a measure of their original sentience, occasionally renewing their relationships with the gods to serve as avatars or guardians. Others choose to remain aloof, pursuing their own goals independent of those who created them. These more potent behemoths sustain themselves through divine rituals learned when they served the gods and passed down from one generation to the next. They use their spell-like abilities to enhance the land and better support their enormous appetites. To replicate these more intelligent and independent raveners, add the following abilities to the standard behemoth. A ravener with these abilities is CR 19 and has Int 14, Wis 18, and Cha 18. It speaks Celestial, Sylvan, and Terran. Spell-Like Abilities (CL 15th): Always active- nondetection; At will-create water, detect animals or plants, purify food and drink, soften earth and stone; 3/day-cure critical wounds, heroes' feast, move earth, plant growth; 1/day- find the path, restoration","<link rel=""stylesheet""href=""PF.css""><div><h2>RAVENER BEHEMOTH</h2><h3><i>The ground quakes as a colossal, elephantine beast of rocky, armored plates presses forward.

Creatures who successfully save cannot be affected by the same blodeuwedd's aura for 24 hours. A blodeuwedd can suppress this aura at will as a free action. The save DC is Constitution-based. Change Shape (Su) A blodeuwedd can assume a single unique humanoid shape or the form of a prairie owl once per day for up to 7 hours as if using the spell polymorph. These hours do not need to be consecutive and a blodeuwedd can return to her normal shape as a free action. Nature's Infusion (Su) Once per day, while surrounded by any field or fertile plain, a blodeuwedd may infuse herself with borrowed life energy from nearby plants and nutrients in the ground. This ability functions exactly like false life (CL 7th) but lasts only 1 hour. Verdant Step (Su) Every stride taken by a blodeuwedd causes small plants, grasses, and wildflowers to sprout from the ground, though she can suppress this effect if she desires. While within a plain of tall grass, brush, or similar undergrowth, a blodeuwedd may also step through such plant-life and emerge at any other point within the same field (potentially miles away). This ability functions similar to transport via plants, but a blodeuwedd can only transport herself and does not require a plant equal to her size. This ability is usable three times per day. Wild Empathy (Ex) This works like the druid's wild empathy class feature, except a blodeuwedd has a +6 racial bonus on the check. A blodeuwedd with druid levels adds this racial modifier to her wild empathy checks.","The mysterious blodeuwedds stand apart from dryads, their tree-bound sisters of the forest, instead watching over the open plains and prairies. They frequently guard the approaches to primeval, fey enclaves as well as various gateways and entry points into the First World-a task they take very seriously. Blodeuwedds hide such regions behind veils of illusion and trickery, quietly observing anyone passing through their lands, and occasionally sending mysterious messages to warn them away or to summon allies that can drive them out. Even when not standing sentinel over a point of otherworldly importance, blodeuwedds find spots of particular natural beauty, transforming such fields-usually only a few acres in size-into sites of unearthly lushness and natural wonder. A typical blodeuwedd stands a little over 5 feet tall, weighs 120 pounds, and may live up to 800 years. Ecology Instead of developing a lifelong bond with trees, blodeuwedds hold an affinity for open grasslands, moors, and plains. They survive off the land, taking nourishment from all that nature provides, while also looking after prairie animals in times of drought or lean winters. Unlike dryads, blodeuwedds have no dependency on the plants around them; they can willingly leave their chosen moor to visit their fey kin, scout their domain in owl form, or even mingle with frontier communities, changing shape to appear elven or human. Every 15 or so years, blodeuwedds may reproduce through a natural ritual of fertility known as the Blooming, a process by which they commune with the adopted plants of their surrounding field. At the height of the spring season, they then exchange pollen with every flower within 300 yards, a complicated and sensuous act that eventually allows a blodeuwedd to conceive. It takes 6 months to carry a new blodeuwedd to term, and they frequently come together to act as midwives during this time to ensure successful deliveries for one another. Some tales tell of blodeuwedds displaced from their homes or in captivity capable of performing the Blooming by drawing off the lifeforce of amorous men, ending in the withering death of the would-be father. Such legends give blodeuwedds a reputation for being dangerous seductresses in some regions. Blodeuwedds typically establish their own prairie holdings within 7 miles of each other for mutual support and ease of communication. Habitat & Society Blodeuwedds make their homes out of sod, carving them from the landscape and then encouraging prairie grass to grow over the exterior to hide them. These elaborate structures resemble small rises and hillocks that overlook ley lines and fairy paths between sites of great power and importance to the fey, which the blodeuwedds jealously guard from nonfey creatures. Most fey recognize such service by referring to blodeuwedds with honorific titles meant to curry their favor. As a result, many blodeuwedds set themselves up as queens or wardens to receive tribute from favored kin who pass through their realms. Blodeuwedds also rely on plant growth and their ability to speak with plants to manage the surrounding fields, encouraging them to grow into complex mazes of hedgerows, tangles, and thickets to better shape their territory. Often they use hallucinatory terrain to hide the best routes through these areas. Interlopers typically find themselves impeded by entangle or areas of spike growth when they enter a blodeuwedd's territory. Any who persist then become targeted by deep slumber or modify memory to lead them in false directions. More rarely, a blodeuwedd might aid one on an important quest, but she usually requires some form of guarantee before agreeing to do so. All blodeuwedds possess tremendous knowledge of and influence over the lands and creatures that border their fields. They often involve themselves in the politics of elves, gnomes, and humans who live nearby-even if only to warn against destructive trespasses or wasteful farming practices. They enjoy playing wind flutes, dancing under the stars, and chasing one another's fairy lights like fireflies among the tall grass. Blodeuwedd Queens Particularly old and active blodeuwedds- typically the eldest within a region that more than 10 blodeuwedds inhabit-sometimes ascend to the status of queens, gaining additional power and prestige among their own kind. They develop a greater affinity for the lands they rule and attract even more followers. The following adjustments to a standard blodeuwedd represent a young blodeuwedd queen at CR 8. More powerful varieties typically add class levels in druid or sorcerer, both of which are considered favored classes for a blodeuwedd queens.

The boar's stubborn nature and habit of eating even bones makes it well suited as a pet for certain folk. Many thieves' guilds keep boars for the disposal of bodies, while orc tribes let them run loose in their lairs, where they do a relatively good job at keeping these warrens clean of refuse.

It yips and bays in a complex pattern, offering warning to anything that may cross its path.",Thylacine,AP 31,0,,"Thylacines are large marsupial carnivores. They typically hunt alone, only occasionally forming small packs. Thylacines hunt at night, and rest during the day in nests hidden away from the world in hollowed trees or bushes. Farmers fear the creatures, blaming all manner of problems on them. However, thylacines are quite shy and antisocial, and usually avoid human settlements. Because of their odd, almost hybrid appearance, thylacines have a far harsher reputation than they probably should, playing a sort of bogeyman role in farming communities. Ecology At a distance, thylacines are sometimes mistaken for dogs or jackals, but can be easily identified by the defining stripes on their gold-hued backs. Thylacines usually have between 13 and 21 dark stripes. Their muscular jaws, filled with teeth, can gape open to an impressive 120 degrees. While thylacines may appear rather quick, they are far from proficient runners. Due to their oddly shaped legs, their run is awkward and slow. However, the animals can stand on their haunches for short periods, helping them to fend off other predators and kill larger prey. Thylacines are also capable jumpers, not dissimilar to kangaroos, and often surprise opponents with this ability. By most standards, a thylacine's senses aren't impressive. They can see and hear well enough to hunt prey, but their olfactory senses, while competent, do not approach canine levels. Thylacines hunt in a manner similar to wolves, focusing on wearing down prey by chasing and harrying instead of direct attacks. Their stomachs are able to greatly distend, enabling thylacines to eat vast amounts of food in a single sitting, devouring larger animals to compensate for long periods of drought or poor hunting. Thylacines are quite cowardly, avoiding confrontation whenever possible. If cornered, a thylacine tries to frighten off attackers with growls, hisses, and threat-yawns, in which it displays its teeth and the full extent of its wide jaws. If these threat displays are ineffective, however, a thylacine does not hesitate to attack. Their powerful jaws may not snap bones, but they can still make quick work of an unprepared traveler. In addition, thylacines are not picky eaters. If driven to starvation, they aren't afraid to hunt humans, in which case their nocturnal hunting cycles tend to lead them to attack sleeping travelers or outlying farms. Thylacines are fiercely independent. While wolves and other canines can be tamed and domesticated, thylacines are wild without exception. If captured, they become territorial and mark everything they can in their territories with strong-smelling odors from their scent glands. Many a farmer has made the sad mistake of attempting to domesticate a thylacine, only to find his farm smelling atrocious and his livestock killed in the night. An adult thylacine stands 2 feet tall at the shoulder, is 4 feet long (not counting an additional 2 feet of tail), and weighs roughly 50 pounds. The larger and more aggressive brush thylacine breed can reach almost 8 feet long from nose to tail-tip, though still only weighing 100 pounds. Habitat & Society Thylacines breed year-round, but like most marsupials, they don't maintain strong family ties. Females keep their young in pouches. Unlike many marsupials, males also have pouches, but these are to protect their genitals, not their young. Females produce about 10 viable joeys in a given breeding season, but only about four can expect to see more than a year of life. The average thylacine lives between 4 and 10 years. Thylacines keep dens similar to those of plains mammals such as foxes and cougars. Dens are often very hard to find, in trees, caves, or other inconvenient locations out of the way of most predators, and in natural shade. Thylacine young reside in the den for only a short period, as joeys stay in their mothers' pouches for most of their development. During periods when a mother is incubating her young, she can be downright violent to trespassers or any other potential threats. Regional Variants Several breeds of thylacine are known to exist, hunting plains and woodlands in regions of Avistan, Garund, and beyond. Three of the most common are noted here. Blood Cougar: Not actually related to the big cats, Tian thylacines are known as blood cougars for their vivid red coloring. Surprisingly, they are often kept as pets by Tian-La leaders, as blood cougars are more easily domesticated and tamed, and serve as far better companions and hunting aids. Although they are slightly smaller than normal thylacines, they make up for it in ferocity and cunning. These red beasts have the advanced creature template (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 294). Casmar Thylacine: In Casmaron, most thylacines are smaller than the typical beast. For this reason, they tend to form larger packs, often twice the size of an average thylacine pack. These smaller beasts stand 6 inches to a foot shorter at the shoulders. Casmar thylacines are normal thylacines with the young creature template added (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 295), and gather in packs of 2-10. Sarusan Wolf: The Sarusan wolf is a slightly bigger and more doglike form of the normal thylacine. Whereas indigenous people refer to the thylacine as a lion or other great cat, the Sarusan wolf has an unmistakable canine jaw. While they are physically larger, Sarusan wolves are actually less hardy than their traditional cousins, due to poor weight allocation. Prone to tiring quickly and falling down, Sarusan wolves focus more on rapid takedowns of their prey. Sarusan wolves have a Constitution score of 12 and gain Power Attack as a bonus feat.

Each hand that does not wield a manufactured weapon in combat grants the calikang a cumulative +1 shield bonus to its AC to a maximum of +4 (a calikang who doesn't wield any weapons does not gain a bonus for the last two free hands). Many calikangs wear decorative bracers on their arms, but the presence or lack of bracers does not aid or impede the creature's defensive slam ability. An actual shield used by a calikang does not stack with this ability. A calikang can make slam attacks with these arms without losing the shield bonus granted from its defensive slam.  Energy Absorption (Su) Whenever a spell effect that normally inflicts energy damage (whether acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic) fails to penetrate the calikang's spell resistance or its immunity to electricity, the calikang absorbs that spell's energy into its body. This heals the calikang an amount of damage equal to the absorbed spell's caster level, and grants it an additional daily use of its energy blast ability.  Energy Blast (Su) Once per day as a standard action, a calikang can direct a beam of energy out of its eyes and mouth. This creates a 60-foot-long line of energy of any kind (the calikang chooses from acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic when it makes its attack) that inflicts 14d6 points of damage on all creatures caught in the blast. Calikangs are particularly adept at using electricity in this manner, and if one chooses to inflict electricity damage, it inflicts 1 additional point of damage per energy blast damage die. A successful DC 22 Reflex save halves the damage done. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Suspend Animation (Su) As a full-round action, a calikang can enter a state of suspended animation, freezing in place and becoming completely motionless. A calikang in suspended animation remains completely aware of its surroundings. It does not age, breathe, grow thirsty or hungry, or move at all.  In this state, a calikang can still be harmed, but is immune to disease, inhaled toxins, poison, starvation, and thirst. It receives a +4 bonus on all Fortitude saves while in suspended animation. A calikang can exit its suspended animation as an immediate action-if it does so to attack a foe or initiate combat, it gains a +4 circumstance bonus on its Initiative check. Often, a calikang leaves its suspended animation as soon as it perceives any foe about to attack it, hoping to achieve the first action in combat.","The wondrous and mysterious calikang is a much sought-after guardian of treasuries, harems, and fortifications-not only because of its great strength and ability to place itself in suspended animation (thus removing the need for regular feedings), but because the monster's very nature often makes it seek out such roles among other races. Legend holds that, an untold number of eons ago, one of the thousand deities of Vudra failed at a task. This deity was Vineshvakhi, god of guardians and defender of the celestial troves and harems. When he failed to prevent an invasion of an important site (in some legends this is another god's harem, while in others it is a treasury) by a small army of asuras, Vineshvakhi cut off the six fingers of one of his hands and cast them down upon the world in shame. When these fingers struck, they caused great devastation upon the world below, but at the core of these six craters rose a new race of being-the calikangs.  Today, the calikang race is a rarity, its members having been driven into isolation and seclusion after a long history among certain rulers of securing calikang guardians for their palaces. The few calikang tribes that survive dwell in the remote temperate and tropical foothills of Vudra's great mountain ranges, often sheltered from the outside world by dense jungles, trackless swamps, or vast deserts. A typical calikang stands 14 feet tall and weighs 4,000 pounds.  Ecology Since their creation so long ago, the calikangs have long sought to pay back the inherited debt of their creator's failure. A newborn calikang's first cognizant thoughts are to guard and defend its mother and home, and as it grows, its instincts and obsession grow as well. A newborn calikang learns to speak within hours, and within days grows to maturity during a painful series of skin moltings and torturous nightmares. Calikangs are not fecund, and the event of a calikang birth is one to be celebrated. And since the week-long process of growing to maturity leaves the young one in a state of peril, an entire calikang tribe assumes guardianship over the nursery for that week. Fully half of these calikang young succumb to the pain and turmoil of this rapid growth and die before reaching maturity, but those who survive emerge from their nurseries fully grown and ready to join the tribe during a hedonistic feast and celebration, the cornerstone of which is the public consumption by the entire tribe of the cast-off flesh and bones of the new member's moltings. At the end of this feast, the tribe's oldest member often leaves the tribe to wander into other lands to offer its services as guardian to another (see Habitat & Society), which tends to artificially limit the size of these ancient tribes.  Once a calikang matures, it can live for 200 years-although many extend their lives immensely through the use of their ability to suspend animation.  Habitat & Society Although calikangs can place themselves in suspended animation at will, they remain alert and aware of the passage of time, and thus only do so when commanded to, or in times of distress (such as during a famine or other natural disaster where ""waiting it out"" is an option for survival). They prefer to spend their time hunting, exploring their territories, and patrolling the edges of these territories on the constant watch for intruders.  Yet all calikangs carry in their soul a powerful sense of guilt and shame over Vineshvakhi's ancient failings, and among their kind is the shared belief that if enough calikangs protect worldly holdings from robberies, invasions, or destruction, this inherited sin will someday be wiped clean and the calikang race will ascend as a whole into the heavens to rejoin their finally redeemed lord and master. As such, each calikang is expected before its death to leave its holding and enter other realms to offer its services as guardian for a predetermined time (usually a period of service equal to a hundred years).  Very few calikangs are lucky enough to find a commander honest enough to honor these terms, and once a calikang enters servitude, the unique mental mindset and guilt of its kind make it nearly impossible for the creature to escape its assignments voluntarily.","<link rel=""stylesheet""href=""PF.css""><div><h2>Calikang</h2><h3><i>With sudden motion, this blue-skinned, six-armed giant lurches to life, the sparkling gems on his golden bracers and bejeweled headdress competing with the glittering edges of his immense swords for attention as he silently adopts a war stance.</i></h3><br></br></div><div class=""heading""><p class=""alignleft"">Calikang</p><p class=""alignright"">CR 12</p><div style=""clear: both;""></div></div><div><h5><b>XP </b>19,200</h5><h5>LN Large monstrous humanoid </h5><h5><b>Init </b>+6; <b>Senses </b>darkvision 60 ft.; Perception +20</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>DEFENSE</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>AC </b>27, touch 11, flat-footed 25 (+2 Dex, +12 natural, +4 shield, -1 size)</h5><h5><b>hp </b>157 (15d10+75)</h5><h5><b>Fort </b>+12, <b>Ref </b>+11, <b>Will </b>+11</h5><h5><b>Defensive Abilities </b>defensive slam, energy absorption, suspend animation,; <b>Immune </b>electricity, mind-affecting effects, negative energy; <b>SR </b>23</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>OFFENSE</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Spd </b>30 ft.</h5><h5><b>Melee </b><i>+1 longsword</i> +18/+13/+8 (2d6+8/17-20), <i>+1 longsword</i> +18  (2d6+8/17-20), 4 slams +16 (1d6+3)</h5><h5><b>Space </b>10 ft.; <b>Reach </b>10 ft.</h5><h5><b>Special Attacks </b>energy blast</h5><h5><b>Spell-Like Abilities</b> (CL 12th; concentration +15)</br>Constant&mdash;<i>air walk</i>,<i> magic weapon</i>,<i> true seeing</i>,<i> water walk</i></br>3/day&mdash;<i>lightning bolt</i> (DC 16)</br>1/day&mdash;<i>chain lightning</i> (DC 19)</h5></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>STATISTICS</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Str</b> 25, <b>Dex</b> 15, <b>Con</b> 20, <b>Int</b> 8, <b>Wis</b> 14, <b>Cha</b> 17</h5><h5><b>Base Atk </b>+15; <b>CMB </b>+23; <b>CMD </b>35</h5><h5><b>Feats </b>Critical Focus, Double Slice, Great Fortitude, Improved Critical (longsword), Improved Initiative, Staggering Critical, Two-Weapon Fighting, Vital Strike</h5><h5><b>Skills </b>Intimidate +21, Perception +20, Use Magic Device +18</h5><h5><b>Languages </b>Common, Giant</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>ECOLOGY</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Environment </b> temperate or tropical hills</h5><h5><b>Organization </b>solitary, gang (2-4), or tribe (5-12)</h5><h5><b>Treasure </b>standard (2 +1 longswords plus other treasure)</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>SPECIAL ABILITIES</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Defensive Slam (Ex)</b> A calikang is adept at blocking and parrying blows with its bony, muscular forearms.

At the end of this feast, the tribe's oldest member often leaves the tribe to wander into other lands to offer its services as guardian to another (see Habitat & Society), which tends to artificially limit the size of these ancient tribes.</p><p>Once a calikang matures, it can live for 200 years-although many extend their lives immensely through the use of their ability to suspend animation.<b></p><p>Habitat & Society</b><br></br> Although calikangs can place themselves in suspended animation at will, they remain alert and aware of the passage of time, and thus only do so when commanded to, or in times of distress (such as during a famine or other natural disaster where ""waiting it out"" is an option for survival). They prefer to spend their time hunting, exploring their territories, and patrolling the edges of these territories on the constant watch for intruders.</p><p>Yet all calikangs carry in their soul a powerful sense of guilt and shame over Vineshvakhi's ancient failings, and among their kind is the shared belief that if enough calikangs protect worldly holdings from robberies, invasions, or destruction, this inherited sin will someday be wiped clean and the calikang race will ascend as a whole into the heavens to rejoin their finally redeemed lord and master. As such, each calikang is expected before its death to leave its holding and enter other realms to offer its services as guardian for a predetermined time (usually a period of service equal to a hundred years).</p><p>Very few calikangs are lucky enough to find a commander honest enough to honor these terms, and once a calikang enters servitude, the unique mental mindset and guilt of its kind make it nearly impossible for the creature to escape its assignments voluntarily.</p></h4></div>",NULL,,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,NULL

This form of telepathy cannot convey language or hinder a target in any way (such as by transmitting pain). A carbuncle can relate a feeling of fear or the faint smell of leaves, but not directly warn an ally that it sees a monster or tell of a treasure under a pile of leaves. Fatal Faker (Su) As a standard action, three times per day, a carbuncle can teleport as per the spell dimension door, but only to a range of 30 feet. Upon teleporting, the carbuncle leaves behind a perfect replica of itself amid a colored flash and the sound of a reptilian choke. This replica duplicates the carbuncle in all ways, though it is obviously dead and the colorless stone in its head is reduced to worthless dust. For all other purposes, the body left behind is treated as though it were an item created by minor creation. Any attempt to heal or resurrect this ΓÇ£bodyΓÇ¥ fails. Dispel magic and similar spells cause the body to vanish, though after 12 hours, the replica melts away into sweet-smelling ooze. Specious Suggestion (Su) As a standard action, three times per day, a carbuncle can concentrate intently on one creature within its line of sight and attempt to impose its will upon the target. Carbuncles have difficulty forcing their wills upon non-carbuncles (and indeed carbuncles are immune to the suggestive powers of other carbuncles), resulting in one of the effects listed below. When using this ability a carbuncle must roll on the following chart. If it dislikes the result, it may make a DC 15 Wisdom check to add or subtract 1 from the result. If the ability check fails, the result changes opposite from the way intended. Targets may attempt to resist the negative effects of a carbuncle's suggestion by making a DC 12 Will save. The carbuncle need not share a language with its target to convey its suggestions. This is a mind-affecting effect. The DC is Wisdom-based. 1d6 Carbuncle Suggestion 1 The carbuncle grants the target a flash of insight into the true future. The target gains a +2 bonus to its AC for the next round. 2 The target is alerted to dangers the carbuncle perceives. The target gains a +2 bonus on any initiative roll made in the next minute. 3 The carbuncle manifests a random image in the target's mind (usually of a food or strangely colored animal). This image lasts for only a moment and has no other effect. 4 The carbuncle's thoughts affect the target similarly to the spell suggestion, though the compulsion lasts for only 1 minute. 5 The carbuncle's thoughts garble those of its target. The target takes a -2 penalty on Will saves for the next round. 6 The carbuncle grants the target a vision of a false future. The target takes a -2 penalty to its AC for the next round. Vulnerability to Suggestion (Ex) Carbuncles prove highly vulnerable to spells with the mind-affecting descriptor. Any mind-affecting spell can affect a carbuncle regardless of typical creature limitations. A spell like charm person or hold person, for example, which typically only affects humanoid creatures, can also affect carbuncles.","Never have legend and misinformation met upon a more inauspicious brow than that of the carbuncle. Even the name summons ideas from the grandiose to the grotesque. The creatures known as carbuncles appear as little more than overly ungainly and well-armored reptiles. What sets them apart, however, are their strange magical abilities and the fist-sized gemstone horn jutting from above their bulging eyes. The elusiveness of these creatures, their natural aloofness, weird powers, and glistening horns have all contributed to the creation and spread of wildly inaccurate tales about these beasts, making truths about them rarer than the awkward creatures themselves. Adult carbuncles stand just over 1 foot tall and about 3 feet long from horn to tail, weighing approximately 12 pounds. The horns of most males range through the spectrum of fiery colors, while the horns of females trend toward cooler shades. Ecology Owing to the rarity of these unusual creatures, numerous and varied tales surround carbuncles. Although few bear any hint of truth, such legends spread from storyteller to storyteller, enlarging the dubious legend of these creatures and endowing them with all manner of doubtful powers. Much of the carbuncle's fame comes from the ""gemstone"" embedded in its head. Although tales differ on the type and value of this precious stone, most claim that a carbuncle bears a ruby, garnet, or almandine. In truth, however, a carbuncle's gem is little more than a highly reflective growth, not dissimilar from humanoid fingernails. To the dismay of those believing tales of valuable gems or stories that tell of carbuncles granting their stones to friendly creatures, these horns crumble swiftly upon removal or the body's death. Although the truth of the matter is common knowledge to most scholars, long-held folktales die hard. Thus, quests for carbuncle gems-and for the creatures themselves-often prove synonymous with rattlesnake eggs or snipe hunts. Habitat & Society Cowardly but practical creatures, carbuncles make their dens wherever they might live comfortably and with little threat from predators and hunters. This typically means near groves of fruit trees deep within ancient forests, amid berry briars in stagnant marshlands, or near falls thick with water bugs. Wherever a carbuncle can eat its fill and hide from both real and imagined dangers, these nervous creatures are satisfied. Such tendencies contribute to the species' rarity, as they have little reason or desire to ramble. Thus, only those who wander the most secluded paths of the world-and even then only those with sharp eyes-ever stumble across carbuncles. Most carbuncles regard others of their kind with indifference. A safe and comfortable glen far from scary creatures might hold up to a half dozen carbuncles, but as soon as the group proves too large for the sanctuary to support, the youngest slink off in search of new homes. Carbuncles-even those living in close proximity-have little to do with others of their kind. While certainly intelligent enough to form relationships and societies, most carbuncles would rather spend their days pilfering honeysuckle, floating in cool springs, or reclining amid shadowy tree branches. Some carbuncle groups have even been known to die out, as none of the members can be bothered to mate. Yet should a group be threatened, they can prove quite clever in distracting enemies from others of their kind. A frequent tactic involves using their empathic abilities to create pleasing smells and sensations to coax dangerous trespassers into the path of other threats while the wily carbuncle quietly slips away. Carbuncle Familiars Carbuncles exhibit a peculiar attraction to magic-users, especially sorcerers with the fey bloodline and any who pack supplies of fresh fruit. Many enchanters laud the extraordinary mind control powers possessed by these intense creatures and extol the aid they can offer mages of their field-though others consider such tales something of an academic in-joke. A spellcaster with the Improved Familiar feat can summon a carbuncle as a familiar at 5th level.","<link rel=""stylesheet""href=""PF.css""><div><h2>Carbuncle</h2><h3><i>This small, awkwardly proportioned reptile trundles along slowly, a fist-sized gem jutting from between two bulging eyes.

Powerful arms end in webbed hands that each clutch barbed hunting spears, and a tumorous bulge protrudes from the back of its neck.",,AP 32,0,"Dual Mind (Ex) The fact that each ceratioidi is actually two creatures sharing the same body gives it a number of unique abilities. A ceratioidi can delegate various actions and physical processes to the individual minds, allowing it to fight with two weapons simultaneously without any penalties. It can also select two favored classes. The telepathic tangle between its twin consciousnesses makes a ceratioidi immune to mindreading spells like detect thoughts and impervious to mindaffecting effects. Lure (Su) As a free action, a ceratioidi can light the dangling lure on its forehead, causing all non-ceratioidi within a 20-foot radius to make a DC 15 Will save or become fascinated for 1d6 rounds. Regardless of the preceding interaction between the ceratioidi and its target, a creature affected by this ability does not view the ceratioidi who has hypnotized it as a potential threat-allowing it to approach without breaking the fascination. Any creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to the same ceratioidi's lure ability for 24 hours. The DCs of this ability are Charisma-based. Primitive Amphibian (Ex) Ceratioidi have rudimentary lungs capable of breathing air indefinitely, but their skin must be bathed in salt water regularly or it begins drying out painfully. They can go for a number of hours equal to twice their Constitution score before they needs to be bathed in salt water-if they don't, they take 1 point of Constitution damage per hour until their Constitution reaches 0, at which point they are completely desiccated and expire. Any Constitution damage accrued is reversed after ceratioidi spend 10 minutes immersed in salt water.","Rulers of the deep ocean trenches, ceratioidi are powerful, intelligent humanoids who share several unusual traits with the aquatic predators of the ceratiidae family, also known as angler fish. From their strange, spired cities beneath the waves, ceratioidi cast their nets of influence far and wide, using their alien intelligence, natural affinity for magic, and hypnotizing lures to manipulate other creatures throughout Golarion's oceans-and beyond. Ecology Perhaps the strangest aspect of the ceratioidi is that each individual is in fact two entities-a powerful, imposing female and a rat-sized, parasitic male. Averaging 7 feet tall and weighing roughly 300 pounds, a female ceratioidi's fleshy body belies both its tremendous strength and its startling intelligence. Males, though equally intelligent, appear to outside observers to be nothing more than fish with vaguely anthropomorphic faces. Born from ribbon-like egg clusters, ceratioidi mature quickly and are ready to mate when 1 year old. During the mating ritual, the tiny male ceratioidi affixes itself to the back of a female's neck and begins secreting an enzyme that dissolves both creatures' skin and transforms them into a single unit. Within a few weeks, what was two creatures has become one-though each retains its own independent consciousness, the male joins his respiration, digestion, and other biological functions with those of the female, becoming nothing more than a bulging organ on his partner's back. While unintelligent angler fish use similar methods in order to self-fertilize at will, a ceratioidi male retains independent thought, and the two linked entities remain in constant telepathic communication, using their combined mental faculties to excel at wizardry and maintain absolute physical precision in combat. This uniquely divided mental structure also makes it easy for ceratioidi to study multiple fields or callings, such as the powerful witch/wizard combination that is their trademark, though it's also common for them to act as underwater rangers. In addition to their dual nature, ceratioidi share a number of other intimidating characteristics with their angler fish cousins. Along with its wide mouth full of inward-curving, needle-sharp teeth, a ceratioidi also possesses the angler fish's fleshy forehead lure, called an esca. This bioluminescent blob dangles at the end of thin spine just above eye level and is the focus for the ceratioidi's innate hypnotic abilities. Through this lure, the ceratioidi can paralyze foes in combat, forcing them to stand still or approach and be culled by the ceratioidi's barbed fishing spear; it can even hypnotize creatures so thoroughly as to make them susceptible to subliminal commands. This ability to manipulate others, combined with the immobile male's natural affinity for magical study and other deeply contemplative arts, makes the ceratioidi masters of their surroundings. Though almost all ceratioidi encountered outside of their homes are fully mated pairs, unmated females can be represented by removing the dual mind ability from the creature's stat block. Males can be simulated by using the statistics for an electric eel without the electricity special ability. Habitat & Society Because they normally construct their cities on the floors of deep ocean trenches or near mineral-rich underwater vents, ceratioidi are rarely encountered by terrestrial races, and little is known about their society save for one region-the tiny nation of Outsea in the River Kingdoms. Long ago, in an effort to use Avistan's river system to circle around their merfolk enemies in a daring military campaign, a group of ceratioidi mercenaries made it all the way up the Sellen before their magic gave out, trapping the ceratioidi and a number of other saltwater races-both friend and foe-in a patch of magically contained brine deep in the heart of the River Kingdoms. Left with no choice but cooperation or death, the various aquatic races pooled their resources and created the isolated community of Outsea, a town existing both above and below the waterline where terrestrial creatures trade with the trapped but still powerful aquatic denizens. The ceratioidi, with their manipulative magic and ability to exist on land for long stretches of time, make perfect gobetweens and bureaucrats for the strange kingdom. Though the ceratioidi are rumored by many to be a product of aboleth experimentation, the ceratioidi of Outsea believe differently. They believe themselves to be the direct descendents of their god-ruler Danglosa, an immense and omnipotent angler fish that accompanied them on their journey and now resides in the flooded caverns deep below Outsea.

A ceratioidi can delegate various actions and physical processes to the individual minds, allowing it to fight with two weapons simultaneously without any penalties. It can also select two favored classes. The telepathic tangle between its twin consciousnesses makes a ceratioidi immune to mindreading spells like <i>detect thoughts</i> and impervious to mindaffecting effects. </h5><h5><b>Lure (Su)</b> As a free action, a ceratioidi can light the dangling lure on its forehead, causing all non-ceratioidi within a 20-foot radius to make a DC 15 Will save or become fascinated for 1d6 rounds. Regardless of the preceding interaction between the ceratioidi and its target, a creature affected by this ability does not view the ceratioidi who has hypnotized it as a potential threat-allowing it to approach without breaking the fascination. Any creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to the same ceratioidi's lure ability for 24 hours. The DCs of this ability are Charisma-based.</h5><h5><b> Primitive Amphibian (Ex)</b> Ceratioidi have rudimentary lungs capable of breathing air indefinitely, but their skin must be bathed in salt water regularly or it begins drying out painfully. They can go for a number of hours equal to twice their Constitution score before they needs to be bathed in salt water-if they don't, they take 1 point of Constitution damage per hour until their Constitution reaches 0, at which point they are completely desiccated and expire. Any Constitution damage accrued is reversed after ceratioidi spend 10 minutes immersed in salt water.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Rulers of the deep ocean trenches, ceratioidi are powerful, intelligent humanoids who share several unusual traits with the aquatic predators of the ceratiidae family, also known as angler fish. From their strange, spired cities beneath the waves, ceratioidi cast their nets of influence far and wide, using their alien intelligence, natural affinity for magic, and hypnotizing lures to manipulate other creatures throughout Golarion's oceans-and beyond.<b></p><p>Ecology</b></p><p> Perhaps the strangest aspect of the ceratioidi is that each individual is in fact two entities-a powerful, imposing female and a rat-sized, parasitic male. Averaging 7 feet tall and weighing roughly 300 pounds, a female ceratioidi's fleshy body belies both its tremendous strength and its startling intelligence. Males, though equally intelligent, appear to outside observers to be nothing more than fish with vaguely anthropomorphic faces. Born from ribbon-like egg clusters, ceratioidi mature quickly and are ready to mate when 1 year old. During the mating ritual, the tiny male ceratioidi affixes itself to the back of a female's neck and begins secreting an enzyme that dissolves both creatures' skin and transforms them into a single unit. Within a few weeks, what was two creatures has become one-though each retains its own independent consciousness, the male joins his respiration, digestion, and other biological functions with those of the female, becoming nothing more than a bulging organ on his partner's back. While unintelligent angler fish use similar methods in order to self-fertilize at will, a ceratioidi male retains independent thought, and the two linked entities remain in constant telepathic communication, using their combined mental faculties to excel at wizardry and maintain absolute physical precision in combat. This uniquely divided mental structure also makes it easy for ceratioidi to study multiple fields or callings, such as the powerful witch/wizard combination that is their trademark, though it's also common for them to act as underwater rangers. In addition to their dual nature, ceratioidi share a number of other intimidating characteristics with their angler fish cousins. Along with its wide mouth full of inward-curving, needle-sharp teeth, a ceratioidi also possesses the angler fish's fleshy forehead lure, called an <i>esca.</i> This bioluminescent blob dangles at the end of thin spine just above eye level and is the focus for the ceratioidi's innate hypnotic abilities. Through this lure, the ceratioidi can paralyze foes in combat, forcing them to stand still or approach and be culled by the ceratioidi's barbed fishing spear; it can even hypnotize creatures so thoroughly as to make them susceptible to subliminal commands. This ability to manipulate others, combined with the immobile male's natural affinity for magical study and other deeply contemplative arts, makes the ceratioidi masters of their surroundings. Though almost all ceratioidi encountered outside of their homes are fully mated pairs, unmated females can be represented by removing the dual mind ability from the creature's stat block. Males can be simulated by using the statistics for an electric eel without the electricity special ability.<b></p><p>Habitat & Society</b></p><p> Because they normally construct their cities on the floors of deep ocean trenches or near mineral-rich underwater vents, ceratioidi are rarely encountered by terrestrial races, and little is known about their society save for one region-the tiny nation of Outsea in the River Kingdoms. Long ago, in an effort to use Avistan's river system to circle around their merfolk enemies in a daring military campaign, a group of ceratioidi mercenaries made it all the way up the Sellen before their magic gave out, trapping the ceratioidi and a number of other saltwater races-both friend and foe-in a patch of magically contained brine deep in the heart of the River Kingdoms. Left with no choice but cooperation or death, the various aquatic races pooled their resources and created the isolated community of Outsea, a town existing both above and below the waterline where terrestrial creatures trade with the trapped but still powerful aquatic denizens. The ceratioidi, with their manipulative magic and ability to exist on land for long stretches of time, make perfect gobetweens and bureaucrats for the strange kingdom. Though the ceratioidi are rumored by many to be a product of aboleth experimentation, the ceratioidi of Outsea believe differently. They believe themselves to be the direct descendents of their god-ruler Danglosa, an immense and omnipotent angler fish that accompanied them on their journey and now resides in the flooded caverns deep below Outsea. Though never seen, its presence is felt regularly through the actions of the Called-""blessed"" individuals suddenly overcome with an all-consuming desire to swim downward and join their dualistic god, never to be seen again. The ceratioidi's distinct resemblance to the kingdom's mysterious leader is just one more reason why the ceratioidi, though in the minority, remain powerful figures in Outsea.</p></h4></div>",NULL,,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,NULL

Relied upon by villains and frightful beings as guardians and gaolers, these three-headed canine abominations possess far greater cunning than their flensed, bestial appearances would suggest-a terrible intellect they pour largely into malice and enjoyment of their victims' tormented ends. Cerberi draw upon a legendary pedigree, all reputedly tracing their lineage to a single primordial evil beast said to still guard the foundations of some forsaken, deathly realm. Brethren to hell hounds, cerberi loathe their distant kin, viciously attacking such hellspawn if not kept at heel by a tyrannical master. Such are the cruel devices of Hell, though, that brazen hatred breeds ingenuity and new evils. Thus, within the depths of the infernal realm, amid the indomitable pits and fortresses of Malbolgia, devils work at nightmarish beast pens, forcibly breeding monstrous hybrids. Born in fury and profanity, Malbolgian cerberi rage forth, ferocious three-headed hell hounds the size of bulls and more than willing and capable of slaughtering their loathed Nessian warhound kindred. A typical cerberi stands a broad 4 feet tall and weighs over 200 pounds, while a Malbolgian cerberi can reach over 6 feet in height and weigh upward of 400 pounds. Ecology Denizens of Hell, cerberi embody the ferocity and covetousness of that realm. Bent to service as watch beasts or guardians at the gates of the Pit, cerberi possess unique abilities predisposing them to such grim service. Bearing some measure of mastery over souls and their fundamental ability to shift between planes, these infernal hounds easily trap their victims, preventing them from escaping to the safety of more favorable realms. This ability allows the beasts to prey upon both spirits and the denizens of the outer planes, which every so often attempt to leap between realms to avoid danger. Physically, cerberi appear akin to mortal canines, though in truth they hold little in common. As natives of Hell, they resemble devils more than the wolves and hounds of the Material Plane, their fleshless figures and three monstrous heads making this obvious at anything less than extreme distances. Despite the differences in physiology between mortal beasts and these keen hunters of souls, cerberi frequently find themselves treated like unthinking animals-largely due to their inability to speak. Such a mistake often proves deadly, as cerberi possess alert minds and genuine cunning. While most willingly accept the commands of more powerful masters and gory compensations for their efforts, cerberi are intelligent enough to know when they've been slighted and viciously turn on creatures who mistakenly think themselves their masters. Habitat & Society In their natural infernal environments, cerberi might be found anywhere powerful fiends have need for guardians. This makes them frequent fixtures among the dark vaults of Erebus, the estates of Dis, and the fortresses of Avernus. Capable trackers, especially adept at detecting the scent of wayward souls, cerberi also might be found among the legions of the first layer of Hell hunting the freshly arrived damned alongside other devils. Yet, beyond all other tasks, these three-headed hounds excel as captors and minders of the dead, assuring that none of Hell's charges escape their eternal fates. Cerberi's incredible ability to trap victims on planes and track the dead make them highly coveted servants across the multiverse. The live markets of Dis teem with cerberi for sale, both ravenous pups and tested hunters. Daemons and night hags especially covet cerberi and pay high prices for whole packs of the soul-hunting hounds. The hounds' bestial appearances and love of slaughter often cause those who consider themselves cerberi owners to forget the deviousness of their allies, a development that often ends poorly, if not bloodily, for the unwary and the weak. Outside of the devil-tamed reaches of Hell and other foul extraplanar wildernesses, small groups of cerberi gather in harsh, pack-like communities. Typically dominated by the strongest or wiliest member, such packs form swift and deadly tides, stalking trespassers upon their vast hunting grounds and doggedly pursuing any scent of lost souls. Although cerberi gain no sustenance from attacking the dead, as befits their infernal nature, all gain a vicious satisfaction at the feeling of an immortal essence discorporating forever within their deadly jaws.","<link rel=""stylesheet""href=""PF.css""><div><h2>Cerberi</h2><h3><i>Amid a chorus of snarls and a mist of blood-flecked foam, a monstrously powerful hound lopes forth.

A chimera is 5 feet tall at the shoulder, nearly 10 feet long, and weighs 700 pounds. Chimeras prefer meat but can subsist on vegetable matter if necessary (although being forced to do so generally leaves the beasts more ill-tempered than usual). Their flight means they can pick and choose their prey, and they usually hunt a large area in search of easy food. They are too stupid and belligerent to acquire followers, though sometimes a tribe of kobolds might give them offerings. Conversely, they are just intelligent and stubborn enough that they make poor pets, and only a significantly more powerful creature can keep them submissive. They may form equal partnerships with a respectful humanoid or similar creature, and even consent to be used as a mount.

Aside from being sinisterly colored, hellfire functions like normal fire, except that half the damage dealt by hellfire is fire damage and the other half results from evil energy and is therefore not subject to being reduced by resistance to fire-based attacks. In addition, all of a chortov's spell-like abilities with the fire subtype produce hellfire instead of normal fire. Hellfire Soul (Su) Upon being reduced to 0 hit points, a chortov explodes in a blast of hellfire. All creatures within 25 feet take 6d6 points of damage from hellfire (see above; DC 22 Reflex save for half ). The save DC is Constitution-based. Upon exploding, the chortov's waning yet still raging soul lingers on as a creature of pure living hellfire. This creature has the same statistics as a Huge fire elemental, except that damage caused by its burn ability results from hellfire and it is not vulnerable to cold. Every round that this hellfire elemental exists, it loses 10 hit points until it dissipates completely. Infernal Bondage (Su) Chortovs wage Hell's wars not by choice, but due to powerful magical bondage. The armor that binds all chortovs bears an infernal curse that compels these murderous fiends to serve the will of their infernal masters. This compulsion can be temporarily dismissed by a break enchantment, dispel law, or dispel magic spell that overcomes a DC 25 dispel check. This frees the chortov of its bondage for 1d6 minutes, during which the baffled creature acts as though under the effects of the spell confusion. Destroying the armor via sundering attacks also frees the devil for 1d6 minutes, after which the armor magically reforms. A chortov's armor has hardness 13 and 45 hit points. Wrath (Su) The anger and hatred of chortovs is infectious. Any creature damaged by a weapon wielded by a chortov or a chortov's slam attack must make a DC 17 or be thrown into a haze of murderous rage, being treated as though under the effects of the spells confusion and rage. This mania lasts for 1 minute, but victims may retry their save to resist every round. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.","Towering, rage-wracked brutes enslaved to the will of Hell, chortovs fume upon the borders and ramparts of Hell's hinterlands, murderous deterrents to any who would besiege the shores of the infernal realm or seek to escape. Born from the remains of souls not destined for Hell but damned nonetheless, chortovs carry with them the rage of those who have suffered the multiverse's cruelest injustice, and by the inescapable yoke of diabolical magic find themselves set upon the enemies of their merciless captors. Trapped within grotesque bodies of writhing, porcine flesh and smoldering hellfire, these horrors hate all things- other creatures, their fate, and the lords who have ensnared them and forced them to serve even past damnation. Standing over 20 feet tall, chortovs are mountains of flesh, muscle, and flame. Each weighing upward of 5 tons, these devils bear plates and bands of diabolical armor that serve as physical manifestations of the infernal sorceries that bind them as eternal slaves to Hell. Each chortov's armor is unique, often bearing images of the vaguely remembered torments their constituent souls once suffered. Their bodies, too, bear incongruities uncommon in other diabolical races, harkening toward the lawless natures of the soul-stuff from which these terrors are sculpted. Ecology Not all souls damned to the depths of the Pit deserve their places therein. Trapped planar travelers, goodly souls slain as diabolical sacrifices, or captives who would otherwise face torments elsewhere upon the planes-all might become prisoners of any one of Hell's inescapable layers, eternally condemned to an unfair damnation. Yet Hell cares nothing for the souls that toil and suffer within its depths, all being fodder for the infinite exertions of the infernal machine. As frightened souls suffer over centuries of horror, losing what once existed of their individuality, those rightfully damned to the Pit join with the fundament of that realm, supplying the infernal realm with the terrible sustenance it requires to- over the span of eons-excrete forth mindless lemures. Yet souls not meant for Hell fail to sustain the plane, collecting in mindless spirit cancers of primal pain and blind rage. From these cysts of wrathful, unrighteous damnation, the powers of Hell forge chains in the shape of terrible armor, creating within gigantic, barely restrained beings of hatred and living hellfire, and turn them toward the enemies of the infernal realm. These towering blasphemies are the chortovs. Despite being unwilling servants of devilkind, chortovs are irretrievable prisoners of Hell. As the processes by which the infernal realm torments, destroys, and refines souls into the stuff of fiends last for innumerable centuries, and as untold numbers of the damned comprise a single devil, no remnant of individual lives, ambition, or memory remains within these gigantic terrors. Yet despite a lack of specifics, all chortovs are consumed by an overwhelming understanding that they are slaves to a hated master and the impotent knowledge that, for all their might and wrath, the one thing they can never strike against is their captors. Thus, while other devils stand united as zealots inspired by the will of the archdevils and Asmodeus himself, chortovs serve only because they must, suffering eternally through a second damnation. Habitat & Society Upon their grotesque creations, most chortovs find themselves stationed on the frontiers of Hell, where they possess innate control over the hellfire that flickers along the infernal realm's brazen ramparts. Their mastery over these infernal flames often sees them recruited away from Avernus, drawn to some of the most dismal forges in the Pit, such as the fortress-cities of Dis and the Burning Legions of Phelgethon, where their titanic strength and rage is harnessed to power the foundries. Chortovs rarely work in groups, each arrogant but typically dull-witted brute harboring a vicious hatred for the grotesqueries, ineptitudes, and injustice tormenting others of their kind. Should they be forced into close proximity by the orders of their lords, such devils tolerate one another, but are quick to quarrel with their monstrous cousins. While such conflicts never come to blows-the chortovs restricted by their armor from defying the will of Hell-the distraction typically overshadows any benefit gained by their tandem efforts. As such, chortovs typically work alongside diabolical keepers, devils with the desires of Hell and its lords intrinsic to their beings. These minders typically come from the ranks of lesser devils, specifically ordered to direct the ferocious destructive might of these gigantic fiends. Barbazus, erinyes, and-most commonly- imps typically serve as minders of their towering brethren, as even greater devils fear the might of those rare chortovs that manage to escape Hell's control.","<link rel=""stylesheet""href=""PF.css""><div><h2>Chortov Devil, Chortov</h2><h3><i>Quivering with heat and barely restrained might, this monstrous, pig-faced titan looms taller than a city wall.

The save DC is Constitution-based.","Clawbats, or einchadu, as they're known to the tribes of greater Iobaria, haunt the desolate expanses of northeastern Avistan and the rugged lands beyond. Swarming forth from their shadowy dens to hunt by night, these strange predators thirst for blood, scavenging from the victims of greater nocturnal hunters and stalking those foolish enough not to fear dangers in the dark. Drawn by the scent of spilled blood, clawbats fearlessly follow deadly beasts, and more than one traveler has narrowly escaped a predator's nearly lethal ambush only to find his luck change as a swarm of wings and eyes descend upon him. The span of an average clawbat's dual pairs of wings stretches 3 feet wide, lifting aloft rubbery bodies weighing 2 to 4 pounds. Tales of more monstrous clawbats, with wings that blot out the stars as they swoop away with children and small animals, also pass through the civilized lands of Iobaria. Such overgrown clawbats might be constructed by making use of the giant creature simple template. Ecology Clawbats are scavengers and opportunistic hunters. They rarely attack creatures larger than rodents or birds unless the creatures-or those traveling with them-have been weakened by a stronger attacker. Even the presence of such a hunter is not enough to deter an ever-hungry clawbat, which is drawn to attack bloodied creatures in the thick of battle. Clawbats are poor fighters; they prefer to fly past victims, strike quickly to draw blood, and then make pass after pass, aggravating their victims' existing wounds with their ribbon-like tongues. This tactic rarely wins the scavengers more than a drop or two of nourishment per attack, driving them to harass a victim until it drops. When the wounds of clawbats' prey prove too insignificant to fell it, clawbats attack more directly, circling to peel away strip after strip of flesh in wet grabs of their tentacular maws. After their prey has fallen to the pain of a dozen such wounds, clawbats land and vigorously lap up their meal until their bellies are bloated with gore. Aiding clawbats in their hunts is their acrid saliva, a stinging milky-white fluid that possesses an anticoagulant quality, causing their bites to leave messy wounds that bleed until treated. This effect allows clawbats to surprise attack most Small creatures and wait safely out of reach until the prey collapses. Healthy larger prey can typically withstand the assault of a lone clawbat, but a whole clutch of the creatures might easily throw even a sturdy beast into panicked, bleeding terror. The freedom with which clawbat wounds bleed also serves to attract other clawbats in the vicinity, and a few scratches might potentially bring an entire clutch down upon even a slightly wounded creature. Clawbat eyes are exceedingly abnormal, being nearly flat, yet still functional. As the creatures' eyes are set upon their wings, the constant flapping gives the clawbats a constantly shifting view of the area around them, but particularly the land below-an experience which would seem terribly jarring to any creature not used to the experience. The eyes are one-sided, occupying only the inner part of their thick, fleshy wings, and are lidless, being constantly watered by ducts surrounding each eye. The profuse watering of these organs causes clawbats to fling a fine spray as they move, which often serves as a victim's first warning of impending danger. Other flying creatures, such as hawks, eagles, and owls, make up the clawbats' natural predators. The sounds of these raptors can dissuade clawbats from attacking, even in the midst of a feeding frenzy, and will send them winging straight for their roost to avoid attack. Giant centipedes occasionally invade clawbat lairs, crawling up the wall or waiting for their prey at the exit. Clawbats have little natural defense against creatures with thick exoskeletons and avoid them when it is possible to attack an easier source of food. Clawbats can live up to 20 years, though most die earlier due to predation, accidents, or infighting. Habitat & Society Clawbats are found far from heavily civilized lands, though whether this is due to civilized efforts to stamp them out or because they prefer distant, half-wild places is open to debate. They live in clutches of up to 15 members, favoring dark places that offer easy aerial access to the outside world. Each of these places must have a roost that allows the creatures to drop the 15 feet necessary to begin flying; if a stationary clawbat attempts to start flying without sufficient drop, it glides to the ground and must mount to a higher point before it can launch again. This makes them skittish in claustrophobic spaces, for they do not like to be at a disadvantage, and this in turn leads them to infest places such as ruined structures, large, open caves, and fissures. New clutches of clawbats contain 4 to 6 young members, which depart a clutch once it has grown to exceed 15 members. The young fly 10 to 15 miles away, searching for a suitable structure or crag to shield them during the day. Once a group of clawbats leaves its original home, the members feel no loyalty to their former family and compete fiercely for resources. On numerous occasions, mages, druids, and barbarians shamans have attempted to capture and train clawbats. While the creatures' awkwardness once they are brought to ground makes them relatively easy to capture-though frustratingly difficult to restrain given their flexibility and many squirming limbs- no documented attempt to train the beasts has ever succeeded. Even efforts paired with steady diets of blood typically end in the clawbat attacking its keeper just as often as availing themselves of the easier food source. This, and their regular attempts to feed even when critically wounded, have won the creatures a reputation for being dumbly vicious, a reputation that leads most thinking creatures to curse and move quickly to exterminate any clawbats that appear in their lands.","<link rel=""stylesheet""href=""PF.css""><div><h2>Clawb at, Clawbat</h2><h3><i>A <i>leathery piece of skin stretched across a frame of joints and bony knobs beats awkwardly through the air.

The cloaker attempts a grapple that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and bites the engulfed victim with a +4 bonus on its attack roll.

The cockatrice's strange ability to turn other creatures to stone is the creature's greatest defense, and a cockatrice lair is invariably littered with petrified remnants of foes.

A typical darkmantle weighs 40 pounds. The creatures' heads and bodies are usually the color of basalt or dark granite, but their webbed tentacles can change color to match their surroundings.  The darkmantle isn't a particularly good climber, but it can cling to a cave roof like a bat, hanging by the hooks at the ends of its tentacles so that its dangling body looks nearly indistinguishable from a stalactite. In this hidden position, the darkmantle waits for prey to pass beneath, at which point it drops and swoops down to attack its victim, slamming its body against the foe and attempting to wrap its webbed tentacles around the target. If the darkmantle misses its prey, it swoops back up and drops again until its prey is vanquished or the darkmantle is grievously injured (in which case the creature flutters back up to the roof to hide and hope its ""prey"" leaves it alone). The darkmantle's inborn ability to cloak the area around it in magical darkness gives it an additional advantage over foes that rely upon light to see.  Darkmantles prefer to dwell and hunt in the caves and passageways that are closest to the surface, as these tend to possess more traffic for the monsters to feed upon. Yet they do not confine themselves to these dark caverns, and can sometimes be found dwelling in ruined fortresses or even in the sewers of bustling cities. Anywhere food is plentiful and there's a ceiling to cling to is a possible den for a darkmantle.  A darkmantle's life cycle is swift-young grow to maturity in a matter of months, and most die of old age after only a few years. As a result, generations of darkmantles quickly accrue, and over the years the evolution of these creatures is similarly swift. In this manner, a cavern's ecosystem can have a signif icant effect on a group of darkmantles' appearance, abilities, and tactics. Aquatic caverns might develop darkmantles that can swim, while those beset with volcanism might generate darkmantles with a resistance to fire.

A typical darkmantle weighs 40 pounds. The creatures' heads and bodies are usually the color of basalt or dark granite, but their webbed tentacles can change color to match their surroundings.</p><p>The darkmantle isn't a particularly good climber, but it can cling to a cave roof like a bat, hanging by the hooks at the ends of its tentacles so that its dangling body looks nearly indistinguishable from a stalactite. In this hidden position, the darkmantle waits for prey to pass beneath, at which point it drops and swoops down to attack its victim, slamming its body against the foe and attempting to wrap its webbed tentacles around the target. If the darkmantle misses its prey, it swoops back up and drops again until its prey is vanquished or the darkmantle is grievously injured (in which case the creature flutters back up to the roof to hide and hope its ""prey"" leaves it alone). The darkmantle's inborn ability to cloak the area around it in magical darkness gives it an additional advantage over foes that rely upon light to see.</p><p>Darkmantles prefer to dwell and hunt in the caves and passageways that are closest to the surface, as these tend to possess more traffic for the monsters to feed upon. Yet they do not confine themselves to these dark caverns, and can sometimes be found dwelling in ruined fortresses or even in the sewers of bustling cities. Anywhere food is plentiful and there's a ceiling to cling to is a possible den for a darkmantle.</p><p>A darkmantle's life cycle is swift-young grow to maturity in a matter of months, and most die of old age after only a few years. As a result, generations of darkmantles quickly accrue, and over the years the evolution of these creatures is similarly swift. In this manner, a cavern's ecosystem can have a signif icant effect on a group of darkmantles' appearance, abilities, and tactics. Aquatic caverns might develop darkmantles that can swim, while those beset with volcanism might generate darkmantles with a resistance to fire. Other darkmantle variants might develop much stonier hides, and instead of swooping down to crush prey might simply drop and pierce them through with their stalactite-like lengths. The deepest, darkest caverns are rumored to host darkmantles of incredible size, capable of smothering multiple human-sized foes at once in their leathery folds.</p></h4></div>",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,NULL,NULL,NULL

A gidim's natural weapon damage is modified by its Charisma bonus. Dread (Su) Gidims are adept at using their spell-like abilities to terrifying effect. At will, and while remaining invisible, a gidim can choose to make any of the spell-like abilities noted in its stat block particularly frightening. Any creature that witnesses and is within 10 feet of the effect of one of these spell-like abilities must make a saving throw or be shaken for 1 minute. This effect can potentially increase the severity of other fear effects. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. Malevolence (Su) Once per day, a gidim on the Material Plane can merge its body with another creature's. This ability is similar to a magic jar spell (CL 10th or the devil's HD, whichever is higher), except that it does not require a receptacle. To use this ability, the devil must be adjacent to the target. The target can resist the attack with a successful DC 16 Will save. A creature that successfully saves is immune to that same devil's malevolence for 24 hours. While using this ability, the gidim is not affected by its otherworldly ability. The save DC is Charisma-based. Nourished by Negativity (Su) Gidims seek out volatile mortals to aid them in entering the Material Plane. At the most basic level, negative emotions occur when a creature is dying, raging, or subject to a fear effect. At the GM's discretion, negative emotions might also include non-rules-related effects, such as extreme feelings of anger, betrayal, frustration, hate, or sorrow. Anytime a gidim witnesses a creature affected by negative emotions, it may choose to gain a +1 bonus on its next Will save made to enter the Material Plane, so long as it attempts to enter the plane within 30 feet of that creature and within 24 hours. If within 12 to 24 hours of gaining this bonus the gidim witness the same creature again being affected by negative emotions, it gains an additional +1 bonus on its Will save which stacks with the original and increases the duration of the bonus by an additional 24 hours. Thus, a gidim may gain a stacking +1 bonus to its Will save in this manner once every 12 hours. The devil loses its entire accumulated bonus if it attempts and fails to enter the Material Plane, if 24 hours pass without it witnessing its target creature being affected by negative emotions, or if it takes a bonus from another creature affected by negative emotions. Once on the Material Plane, this bonus applies to a gidim's Will saves made to resist being expelled from the plane. The bonus decreases by 1 every minute until it reaches 0. A gidim that leaves the Material Plane before this bonus reaches 0 retains any remaining bonus. Otherworldly (Ex) Gidims find it difficult to enter the Material Plane. To do so by any means, a lesser possession devil must make a DC 30 Will save, failure meaning it is barred from entry and cannot access the plane again for 12 hours. In addition, after every minute of being on the Material Plane, the devil must make a DC 30 Will save or be expelled, returning to the plane it traveled from. Additionally, as a free action a number of times per day equal to the gidim's Charisma modifier, the devil can empower one of its spell-like abilities to extend out from the Ethereal Plane and affect a target on the Material Plane. Sunlight Weakness (Ex) Gidims' powers are weakened in natural sunlight (not merely a daylight spell), reducing the DCs of their special abilities by -4. In addition, gidims attempting to enter the Material Plane into an area of sunlight take a -4 penalty on their Will save.","Diabolically clever and immortally creative, the legions of Hell use all the tools at their disposal to undermine and corrupt the souls of mortalkind. Among these tools are the souls of unabashedly depraved and hateful mortals sentenced to Hell in punishment for lives of sin. The foulest of these souls occasionally find themselves plucked from their torments and reforged in infernal crucibles, etched with bindings of hellish magic, then set loose upon the living. These evil souls bear many of the powers of devils, but fall outside the normal infernal hierarchies, not being considered true devils by their fiendish peers. Rather, they are gidims, Hell-bound souls made weapons of the Pit. More than mere souls yet less than fiends, gidims find themselves barred from the mortal plane by the laws of existence. Their minds and memories linger on half-forgotten lives, however, and upon emotions and sensations long lost to fiends. Thus, they endlessly seek ways to infiltrate the paths of the living. Traveling to the Ethereal Plane, they peer into the Material Plane, seeking out hapless mortals and drawing power from their hatred, their violence, their sorrow, and especially their fears. Continued feeding upon and encouragement of such emotions grants them greater ability to invade the mortal realm and potentially steal new bodies, through which their foulness might live again. Two breeds of gidim exist, lesser possession devils and greater. Both appear nearly identical, but greater possession devils are created from spirits of extraordinary, near-legendary evil beings. These foulest of souls are granted even more powerful diabolical abilities and are often loosed by their infernal masters to torment, unhinge, and ultimately destroy the mortal enemies of Hell. Lesser possession devils are typically left to their own devices, using their abilities to sow fear, torment innocents, spread mistrust, and ruin lives.","<link rel=""stylesheet""href=""PF.css""><div><h2>Devil, Possession  Greater (Gidim)</h2><h3><i>An impression of unmistakable malice pervades the area, the vague yet undeniable sensation of looming malevolence and faint foul breath.</i></h3><br></br></div><div class=""heading""><p class=""alignleft"">Greater Gidim</p><p class=""alignright"">CR 15</p><div style=""clear: both;""></div></div><div><h5><b>XP </b>51,200</h5><h5>LE Medium outsider (devil, evil, extraplanar, incorporeal, lawful)</h5><h5><b>Init </b>+8; <b>Senses </b>darkvision 60 ft., see in darkness; Perception +27</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>DEFENSE</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>AC </b>24, touch 24, flat-footed 15 (+5 deflection, +8 Dex, +1 dodge)</h5><h5><b>hp </b>187 (15d10+105)</h5><h5><b>Fort </b>+16, <b>Ref </b>+19, <b>Will </b>+12</h5><h5><b>DR </b>10/good; <b>Resist </b>acid 10, cold 10; <b>SR </b>26</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>OFFENSE</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Spd </b>30 ft., fly 40 ft.

This effect can potentially increase the severity of other fear effects. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. Malevolence (Su) Once per day, a gidim on the Material Plane can merge its body with another creature's.

Dragon turtles claim vast territories in the open seas, encompassing regions often in excess of 50 square miles.  Here, these dangerous beasts capsize ships that fail to respect their territories, adding the sunken wrecks and their valuable cargoes to their lairs. Dragon turtles generally make their homes in deep caves only accessible through the water, and often decorate their lairs not only with the wealth seized from ships they've sunk, but the wrecks of these unfortunate ships themselves.

Large fish, such as tuna, sturgeons, and even sharks, rank among dragon turtles' favorite foods, but being omnivores, they also sometimes feed on large undersea fields of seaweed. They certainly aren't above supplementing their diets with the passengers of ships they sink, although such feeding is not borne of any intrinsic evil or cruelty.

Other diseases commonly carried include demon fever, filth fever, and slimy doom.

Panicked animals remain so as long as they are within 30 feet of the drekavac.

Destroying a drekavac with remove curse or remove disease does not cure any of the creature's diseases.  Vulnerability to Salt (Ex) Drekavacs are vulnerable to salt that has been consecrated in the same fashion as holy water, and cannot cross an unbroken line of blessed salt. A handful of blessed salt thrown at a drekavac inflicts the same damage as a flask of holy water (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 160).","Drekavacs are the undead remains of children who perished from disease, particularly in plague-ridden areas where many such deaths occurred in a short period of time. Able to become as insubstantial as the mist rising from a graveyard on a cold, dark night, drekavacs are carriers of disease, seeking to infect the living with the afflictions that slew them. According to some stories, drekavacs only result from young plague victims who remain unburied or died bereft of the proper funeral rites; performing those rites may allow their spirits to rest and no longer haunt the world of the living.  Ecology Drekavacs typically haunt desolate places, from windswept plains and mountains to dark forests and abandoned homes or villages. They may move among inhabited areas in gaseous form, but are typically warded off by bright lights and the sounds and sights of life. They are always encountered indoors or at night, preferring dark, cloudy or foggy nights, ideally during the waning moon. Drekavacs are usually encountered during the gloomy, cold winter months rather than in the spring or summer.  Rural clerics and adepts must sometimes deal with one or more drekavacs seeking to spread disease in their communities. Their favored targets are children, some of whom can also become drekavacs 3 days after death unless their bodies are burned and the ashes scattered.  The work of drekavacs in a community can sometimes lead to hysterical accusations by grief-stricken parents and families, stirring up resentment and violence toward outsiders or anyone suspected of involvement with unnatural forces.  It is customary in some rural areas to surround a child's crib with a ring of blessed salt to keep evil influences at bay, including drekavacs, who cannot cross an unbroken line of salt. However, drekavacs can convince others to break the line of salt for them.  Habitat & Society Drekavacs are lonesome, bitter, and pitiful creatures, often crying when they appear, mourning their lost lives. Some folk mistake them for living children, lost or starving, although the creatures are not very effective liars. Still, a dim night and a half-seen form huddled and sobbing pitifully are often enough to trick someone into approaching close enough to become victim of the drekavac's chilling grasp.  Once they have inflicted their plagues upon victims, drekavacs quickly lose interest and move on, although they may follow a victim, begging for aid and attention, behaving as if they were still living victims of disease rather than its agents. They rarely kill victims outright, preferring instead to inflict long and lingering deaths through disease. Drekavacs threatened with salt, magic, or silver weapons become vicious, attacking opponents like snarling dogs until they are dead or the creatures are driven off.  Drekavacs sometimes band together in small packs, particularly in places where epidemics or plagues have swept through a population, either recently or long ago, but they have no real organization beyond seeking out new victims to infect. Drekavacs are intelligent and aware, able to converse in Common, or whatever languages they knew in life. This means some drekavacs are only able to communicate in largely dead or forgotten languages. They are childlike in their understanding and largely incapable of being reasoned with, but deft use of Bluff or Diplomacy and a playful or parental tone may keep a drekavac at bay, at least temporarily.","<link rel=""stylesheet""href=""PF.css""><div><h2>Drekavac</h2><h3><i>Dressed in graveyard rags, this pitiful creature cries out like a sick child.

Drow have dark skin, ranging from black to a hazy purple hue. Most drow have white or silver hair and white or red eyes, but other colors are not unheard of. Drow society is ruled over by powerful nobility, themselves governed by sadistic and dangerous matriarchs who constantly plot and scheme against rival houses and lesser kin within their own families. The majority of drow are the common soldiers and decadent citizenry, with base stats as presented here-drow nobles are more powerful and dangerous, and are detailed on the facing page. In combat, drow are thoroughly ruthless, with little regard for fairness or mercy. They prefer to attack from ambush or to lure enemies into situations where they clearly have the upper hand. If things turn against them, drow are quick to flee, leaving slaves and minions to cover their escape. Drow Characters Drow are defined by their class levels-they do not possess racial Hit Dice. All drow have the following racial traits. +2 Dexterity, +2 Charisma, -2 Constitution: Drow are nimble and manipulative. Medium: Drow are Medium creatures, and have no bonuses or penalties due to their size. Normal Speed: Drow have a base speed of 30 feet. Darkvision: Drow can see in the dark up to 120 feet. Drow Immunities: Drow are immune to magic sleep effects and get a +2 racial bonus to saves against enchantment spells. Keen Senses: Drow receive a +2 racial bonus on Perception checks. Spell Resistance: Drow possess spell resistance equal to 6 plus their class levels. Spell-Like Abilities: A drow can cast dancing lights, darkness, and faerie fire each once per day, using his total character level as his caster level. Light Blindness: Abrupt exposure to bright light blinds drow for 1 round; on subsequent rounds, they are dazzled as long as they remain in the affected area. Poison Use: See Special Abilities, above. Weapon Familiarity: Drow are proficient with the hand crossbow, rapier, and short sword. Languages: Drow begin play speaking Elven and Undercommon. Drow with high Intelligence can choose bonus languages from the following: Abyssal, Aklo, Aquan, Common, Draconic, Drow Sign Language, Gnome, or Goblin. Drow Nobility About one out of every 20 drow is gifted with special powers from birth-the overwhelming majority of these exceptional drow are female, and as a result, drow society tends to be matriarchal in nature. These special births are engineered and encouraged among the ruling caste, and are far more likely to occur when the mother is of noble heritage. Strangely, the status of the father seems not to increase or decrease the chances of a child being born a drow noble. Common drow children born to nobles are usually put to death-sacrificed to one of the many demon gods to whom the drow offer worship. It is rare for a drow noble to be born to common parents, but those who are usually murder their parents or family before they come of age in order to hide the truth of their base upbringing and to ease the processes of joining one of their society's noble houses. Drow nobles are more powerful than the majority of their kin, and as such they quickly rise to power within their houses. Advancement through the hierarchy of a drow noble house is usually accomplished through a combination of assassination, seduction, and treachery, leading most drow in power to be overly paranoid. Drow Noble Characters Drow nobles are defined by their class levels-they do not possess racial Hit Dice. A drow noble's challenge rating is equal to her class level. Drow nobles possess all of the racial traits listed above for drow characters, plus the following. +4 Dexterity, +2 Intelligence, +2 Wisdom, +2 Charisma, -2 Constitution. Noble drow are very agile, observant, and regal. These ability score modif iers replace the standard drow ability score modif iers. Spell Resistance: Drow nobles have spell resistance equal to 11 + their character level. Spell-Like Abilities: Drow nobles can cast dancing lights, deeper darkness, faerie fire, feather fall, and levitate each at will, and have detect magic as a constant spell-like ability. A drow noble can also cast divine favor, dispel magic, and suggestion once per day each. In some cases, a drow noble's spell-like abilities might vary, although the level of a particular spelllike ability does not.

Duergar dwell in communities deep underground, and appear as darker, more twisted versions of their kinder kin. Their skin is a dull gray, as though rubbed with dust or ash, but this is a natural coloration that better allows them to blend with their underground surroundings. They are a race of slavers, but while non-dwarven prisoners are usually put to backbreaking work, dwarven prisoners are generally slain on the spot. In combat, duergar fire crossbows from a distance, then shift to the warhammer after a few rounds. If outnumbered, or given sufficient threat (and space), a duergar will use its enlarge person ability and begin lashing out at its enemies.

Slow and Steady: Duergar have a base speed of 20 feet, but their speed is never modified by armor or encumbrance. Darkvision: Duergar can see in the dark up to 120 feet. Duergar Immunities: Duergar are immune to paralysis, phantasms, and poison. They also gain a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against spells and spell-like abilities. Stability: Duergar receive a +4 racial bonus to their CMD against bull rush or trip attempts while on solid ground. Spell-Like Abilities: Duergar can cast enlarge person and invisibility each once per day, using their character level as their caster level.

Carved from a single block of stone or other sturdy material, these constructs resemble towering statues, crafted to appear as servants of specific deities and often etched with icons sacred to their worship. In addition to its fearful body, an ebon acolytus is typically crafted with a companion altar, upon which it might aid its master or an unholy congregation in dark rites and ritual bloodletting. The exact height and weight of an ebon acolytus varies, largely depending on the shape of its body and the quality of the stone used in its creation, though most rise to around 14 feet tall and weigh around 2,500 pounds. Some carry Large sacrificial weapons other than daggers, but these prove rare and vary between faiths. Ecology As artificial creations, ebon acolyti have no bodily needs or functions. This allows them to perform well as both grim altar attendants and as defenders of unholy sites. Clandestine cults often go to great lengths to create ebon acolyti just for this reason, as such groups' survivals rely upon the secretiveness of their worship. In some rare instances, especially old and well-used ebon acolyti have been known to defy their creators, but only when such masters have defied the will or tenets of their deity. Religious figures claim such rarities are not a sign of devotion from the constructs themselves, though, but instead a manifestation of a deities' will operating through a convenient medium. Habitat & Society Altar golems are typically found in places of dark worship, from the expected locations like depraved dungeons and temples consecrated in the name of sinister gods to hidden shrines under the homes of supposedly reputable neighbors or secret mountain hollows. Wherever the perverse will of foul deities takes root, there ebon acolyti might be found. An ebon acolytus's most feared ability is its power to sacrifice living creatures to the dark entity to whom it is devoted. This foul capability rises from a series of profane rites conducted as part of the construct's creation, during which it is bound to a specific patron. A ebon acolytus cannot be reconsecrated to a different deity, and those it sacrifices always appear in the same extraplanar realm. The being an ebon acolytus is created to serve must be of at least deity-level power, and all attempts to create servants that direct souls to a lesser or more vague source fail. Thus, ebon acolyti are typically found dedicated to evil gods, demon lords, archdevils, one of the four horsemen, or similar beings. Those killed by an ebon acolytus prove exceedingly diffcult to recover, except by the power of those devoted to the deity to whom the victim was sacrificed. As such, foul priests often employ ebon acolyti to gain bargaining chips, having their construct minion sacrifice a being and demanding some service should the victim's loved ones wish him returned. Alternately, worshipers of notorious deities often face worldly retribution, but might escape tenacious pursuers by sacrificing themselves to their deity, their sacrificial deaths allowing them to forever elude the magic and vengeance of their foes. Occasionally, there are those who seek to track down and reclaim souls wrongfully slain by ebon acolyti. Many quests to unholy realms have been undertaken in the attempt to rescue such damned souls, though few meet with any success. Although most discussion of ebon acolyti connects them with foul deities, such need not be the case. Tools first and foremost, these constructs might serve non-evil gods, though in most cases their murderous aptitudes are ill suited to such worship. In some cases, particularly in the instances of exotic and little-known deities who prove both benevolent and bloodthirsty, ebon acolyti might be found in the service of goodly faiths, though such instances are exceedingly rare. Construction An ebon acolytus is chiseled from a single block of dark stone, often black granite or marble, jade, or some other lustrous material, and weighing at least 4,000 pounds. The stone must be of exceptional quality and costs at least 6,000 gp. Ebon Acolytus CL 11th; Price 24,000 gp CONSTRUCTION Requirements Craft Construct, animate objects, desecrate, trap the soul, creator must be caster level 11th; Skill Craft (sculpting) or Craft (stonemasonry) DC 16; Cost 12,000 gp Ebon Acolyti on Golarion Though rare, ebon acolyti have been found throughout Golarion, consecrated to a host of foul patrons. While many watch over temples and holy sites of Rovagug, Lamashtu, and Asmodeus-and peripheral shines to his archdevils-they are more commonly found in squalid holes where demon and daemon worshipers enact their blasphemous ceremonies. Below are two particularly infamous ebon acolyti. The Altar of Angazhan: Deep in the Mwangi Expanse lies an ebon acolytus dedicated to the demon lord Angazhan, the Ravener King and Lord of Apes. Carved from obsidian, the altar resembles Angazhan himself, a brutish ape with savage tusks and six long, slender fingers. Unlike other altar golems, the Altar of Angazhan speaks through the Voice of Angazhan, the animated and endlessly furious skull of a massive gorilla that serves as the construct's head. Although the skull possesses only the intellect of an average ape, it ""leads"" a pack of charau-ka that worships it as their god. The tribe's shamans interpret their lord's will in his endless grunts and howls, directing their people to scour the Expanse for food, riches, and sacrificial victims. The Midnight Temple of Egorian: Found in Cheliax's infernal capital, this massive, marble-carved ebon acolytus is known as the Black Altar. Shaped into the likeness of a humanoid devil with sweeping horns and monstrous wings, the Black Altar seems to be carved straight from the layers of Hell itself. At the stroke of midnight on the first day of every ninth week, nine slaves are sacrificed here to the God Fiend, the Black Altar absorbing their blood and sending their souls screaming to Asmodeus. When the altar prepares to kill its victims, its great wings close so none can see the final blow, and when they open again, nothing of the sacrifice remains.","<link rel=""stylesheet""href=""PF.css""><div><h2>EBON ACOLYTUS</h2><h3><i>A chilling statue strands behind a dark altar, both smeared with evidence of grisly sacrifices.

Related to deer, elk prove important parts of many ecologies, being able to fend off or flee many threats while feeding greater predators. Their size, strength, and antlers-reaching up to 10 feet wide on some males- allow them to contend with most of their environment's dangers, though herds generally favor flight to combat. Elk also prove exceptionably adaptable and remarkable survivors, capable of living through severe changes in weather and in a variety of environments without concern. Many humanoid cultures rely on elk herds, using them as valued food sources, work animals, and companions. Most breeds of elk stand between 3 and 5 feet tall and weigh between 350 and 550 pounds, with females being far slighter than males. Heartier stock, such as the river elk seen throughout the River Kingdoms, Brevoy, and much of northern Avistan and Iobaria, grow to approximately 6 feet tall and weigh between 700 and 1,100 pounds. In some secluded wilds, primeval megaloceros-massive ancestors of the elk-still flourish, standing up to 9 feet tall, with bulks of 1,500 pounds and antlers growing over 12 feet wide. In all species, only male elk grow antlers. Female elk have the same statistics as males, but lack the gore or powerful charge attacks. Ecology Elk live relatively long lives for herd animals, with some bulls living for over 15 years. Physiologically, they're similar to deer and other grazing animals with their patterns of travel and interaction with other creatures. Because of their size, though, they can damage an ecosystem, eating great amounts of food and sometimes competing with other herbivores for resources. Bull elk keep their antlers for about 7 to 8 months of the year, maintaining them as a primary form of defense. The antlers of common elk stand 4 feet tall and spread about 6 feet wide. Both bulls and cows are quite strong, their kicks proving deadly deterrents against many would-be attackers. Most breeds of elk stay in herds with upwards of 50 members. Herd members actively protect each other, doing what they can to defend those incapable of fleeing, yet also recognizing hopeless causes. Very few predators can stand up to a group of defensive elk, though wolves, bears, boars, and hunting cats often attack the young, sick, or unwary who venture away from the herd. While most natural predators steer clear of elk herds, many humanoid or monstrous hunters manage to pick off elk by relying on ranged weapons or great physical prowess. Habitat & Society During most of the year, elk maintain large groups of their own genders. Cows and the young tend to stick near dens, so bulls are more likely to be found wandering their wide territories. During mating season, a dominant bull maintains a harem of as many as 20 cows. Any threat to that establishment is met with violent force, with battles between rivals often resulting in fierce clashing of antlers and contests of strength-though such rarely prove deadly. During mating season, cows don't always produce offspring, though when they do, typically only one or two elk are born. After mating season, cows care for calves for only a short time. Most are only nursed for a couple of months before they join with the rest of the herd. Elk are hibernating creatures, being almost unheard of during the winter season. During the remainder of the year, they roam and graze widely. When they make their tell-tale noise (called bugling,) it booms and echoes for miles, and females often consider the loudest males the most suitable as mates. Elk migrate throughout the year, typically to avoid the snow. They move from low to high ground, where tree bark is an abundant food source. During the summer months, they graze on the grasses they can find. During dry seasons, elk often make great trips to find abundant food sources, which can sometimes force out lesser creatures from a habitat. Elk are also know to vary widely from region to region. Common in Brevoy, the River Kingdoms, and secluded spots of Numeria, river elks prove larger and heartier than most of their brethren. Named for their tendencies to travel along rivers and the comfort with which they enter water, these elk exhibit a daring unknown to most other breeds, the bulls willingly fighting to defend their herds from any perceived threats. Megaloceros Similar in form to the elk but far superior in size is the megaloceros. The average male is a towering, dangerous creature with antlers that can alone weigh nearly 100 pounds. Unlike elk, megaloceros antlers are decidedly enormous and sometimes wider than their bodies are long. This leads to common misconceptions and exaggerations about the creature's monstrous size. Conveniently for those pursued, megaloceros males have difficultly navigating thickly forested areas, making them natives of plains and the woods' edge.

Those failing a DC 27 Reflex save suffer 2d8+8 points of piercing damage and the kyton may make a combat maneuver check as an immediate action to grapple each victim with the animate chains. A successful save cuts the damage in half and avoids the grapple opportunity. Those successfully grappled by the chains become subject to the kyton's pull ability. A kyton cannot use its breath weapon again while it is grappling or pulling creatures with its breath weapon chains. Otherwise, it may use the breath weapon once every 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based. An ephialtes kyton's chains (hardness 10, hp 10, Break DC 26) can be broken, or attacked by making a sunder attempt. If the chain is currently grappling a target, the attacker gains a +4 circumstance bonus on the CMB check to sunder. Severing a chain deals no damage to a kyton. Chain Armor (Ex) The chains that adorn an ephialtes kyton grant it a +8 armor bonus, but are not treated as armor for the purpose of arcane spell failure, armor check penalties, maximum Dexterity, weight, or proficiency. Dancing Chains (Su) An ephialtes kyton can control up to four chains within 30 feet as a standard action, making the chains dance or move as it wishes. In addition, the kyton can increase these chains' length by up to 15 feet and cause them to sprout razor-sharp barbs. The chains attack as effectively as the kyton itself. If a chain is in another creature's possession, the creature can attempt a DC 22 Will save to break the ephialtes kyton's power over that chain. If the save is successful, the kyton cannot attempt to control that particular chain again for 24 hours or until the chain leaves the other creature's possession. An ephialtes kyton can climb chains it controls at its normal speed without making Climb checks. The save DC is Charisma-based. Entrapping Chains (Su) With a successful combat maneuver check, an ephialtes kyton may transfer an adjacent creature grappled by the kyton's breath weapon chains to the chains adorning its body, giving the target the pinned condition while the kyton deals with remaining foes. The kyton does not retain the grappled condition while pinning such creatures. Pinned victims can free themselves with a combat maneuver check to break the pin or an Escape Artist check. Other creatures can attempt to free pinned victims by making a sunder attempt (hardness 10, hp 10). An ephialtes kyton may entrap 1 Large, 2 Medium, 8 Small, 32 Tiny, or 128 Diminutive or smaller opponents. Pull (Ex) An ephialtes kyton has a +4 racial bonus on CMB checks made using its pull special attack.","Sadistic hunters and tormentors of all living souls, ephialtes kytons usually roam the planes in service to the lords of Hell and Shadow, but occasionally in pursuit of their own fell interests. They ruthlessly abduct the innocent and retrieve the damned, dragging their victims into the fires of Hell or the gnashing, wailing dark of the Plane of Shadow. They have no fear, tracking their chosen prey regardless of distance or challenge, and shackle dragons, giants, and humanoids alike for their eternal torturous rewards. Ephialtes kytons travel in silent grace while cloaked in darkness, but drop their stealthy veils when ready to intimidate those they've come to collect or punish. Then, their frightening gaze matches the deadly intent of the chains piercing their flesh. These animated, wrought iron bands serve as protection and weapons in the hands or claws of all kytons, but may also bind and lash their victims to the ephialtes' ever-bleeding hide to carry them into the Great Beyond. A typical ephialtes stands 25 feet tall and weighs over 15 tons with the combined burden of their deadly chains. Ecology An ephialtes kyton results from the ritual transformation of a lesser kyton which has slain or bound 999 mortal victims in the soulless dark of the Shadow Plane. Thereafter, it gains the ability to shadow walk and expand its access to other planes without waiting for summoners to request its services. Eternally vigilant and opportunistic, ephialtes kytons hunt for further victims for young kytons to practice upon. Because of their honed expertise in capturing and tormenting souls, ephialtes are highly useful to the diabolical elite-both mortals and the immortal lords of Hell-who seek out ephialtes kytons as fell servants. Some kytons willingly align themselves with the rulers of Hell, taking further delight in the various torments available in that realm. Habitat & Society Ephialtes kytons shepherd and rule over the entirety of kyton society. Though not especially cunning compared to other fiends, they still possess a fierce loyalty to their own kind and adhere to a rigid hierarchy of power and achievement. Their homes within the Plane of Shadow remain eternally hidden, with the sounds of flesh-flensing chains providing the only insight into their torturous methods. Few outsiders understand the purpose of these elaborate torments, though rumors suggest they further empower the ephialtes to ever-greater transformations. Summoning Ephialtes Kytons As long as a conjurer doesn't interrupt an ongoing hunt, most ephialtes kytons relish being summoned, looking forward to the sport of chasing down newly assigned prey or punishing those who fail to properly bind them. Any Charisma check made as part of the greater planar binding spell to convince an ephialtes kyton to undertake a mission other than the murder, abduction, or torture of specific victims suffers a -2 penalty. Once an ephialtes kyton accepts an assignment, it demands 1,000 gp paid in black onyx or opals for every Hit Die its target possesses. If the summoner cannot pay the price in the required gems, the kyton only partially carries out the requested service-maiming instead of murdering, abducting for only a limited time (typically 1d4+3 days), or only torturing a victim until it answers a single question as part of an interrogation. If a summoner tries to force an ephialtes kyton to perform a different type of service or accept a different form of payment, the kyton takes offense and all of the summoner's future Charismarelated interactions with the ephialtes suffer a -2 penalty. Once an ephialtes kyton has agreed to a task, only its assigned prey interests it. Ephialtes kytons always offer to dispose of such victims by taking them to the Shadow Plane so they can help lesser kytons obtain the necessary number of souls to become ephialtes.","<link rel=""stylesheet""href=""PF.css""><div><h2>KYTON, EPHIALTES </h2><h3><i>Amid a roiling cloud of deepest dark, the rattle of chains and heavy footfalls announce a being of immense size.

An ettercap gains a +4 racial bonus on this check. Spiders are mindless, but this empathic communication imparts on them a modicum of implanted intelligence, allowing ettercaps to train giant spiders and use them as guardians. Traps (Ex) The ettercap is particularly skilled at crafting cunning traps with its webs. Deadfalls, nooses, and spear traps are the most common traps ettercaps build with their webs. An ettercap doesn't require gold to build its traps, merely time. Rules for crafting traps can be found in Chapter 13 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook.

They are solitary creatures and rarely group with others of their kind, even to mate. When they do group, they tend to attract a variety of different spiders, forming a strange collective of ettercaps and arachnids. Ettercaps are known for building cunning traps out of webs and other natural materials, using them to trap prey. They build shelters out of webbing, often high up in the trees away from other ground-based predators, and use monstrous spiders as lookouts and guardians.

They constantly train for war and practice brutal tactics on anyone and everyone that gets in their way. Their rigid command structure is complete with soldiers, officers, and even generals, and they obey orders from their kings unquestioningly.  Fire giants have bright orange hair that flickers and glows almost as if it were af lame. An adult male is 12 to 16 feet tall, has a chest that measures 9 feet around, and weighs about 7,000 pounds. Females are slightly shorter and lighter. Fire giants can live to be 350 years old.  Fire giants wear sturdy cloth or leather garments colored red, orange, yellow, or black. Warriors wear helmets and half-plate armor of blackened steel and wield large greatswords that they use to cut swaths across the battlefield. In large groups, fire giants fight with brutal and efficient group tactics, and aren't afraid to sacrifice one or two of their members to draw an enemy into an ambush.  Fire giants prefer hot locations-the hotter, the better.  They've been found in deserts, volcanoes, hot springs, and deep beneath the earth near lava vents.

Frost giants usually start combat at a distance, throwing rocks until they run out of ammunition or the opponent closes, then wading in with their enormous greataxes.

Frost giants can hide well in snowy environments and are masters of stealth in their domain.  Frost giants survive on hunting and raiding alone, as they live in desolate, frigid environments. Frost giant groups are split almost evenly between those that live in makeshift settlements or abandoned castles and those that roam the frozen north as nomads in search of spoils and provisions. Frost giant leaders call themselves jarls and demand absolute obedience from their followers. At any time a jarl may be challenged by combat for leadership of the tribe.

A gargoyle that uses freeze can take 20 on its Stealth check to hide in plain sight as a stone statue.,"Gargoyles often appear to be winged stone statues, for they can perch indefinitely without moving, allowing them to surprise their foes.  Gargoyles tend toward obsessive-compulsive behaviors that are as varied as their kind is plentiful.  Books, stolen trinkets, weapons, and grisly trophies harvested from fallen foes are just a few examples of the types of things a gargoyle might collect to decorate its lair and territory. Gargoyles tend toward a solitary lifestyle, though they sometimes form fearsome groups called ""wings"" for protection and sport. In certain conditions, a tribe of gargoyles might even ally with other creatures, but even the most stable alliances with a gargoyle tribe can collapse for the smallest of reasons-gargoyles are nothing if not treacherous, petty, and vindictive.  Gargoyles have been known to dwell in the heart of the largest of cities, crouching amid the decorations of stone cathedrals and buildings where they hide in plain sight by day and swoop down to feed on vagabonds, beggars, and other unfortunates at night.  The longer a tribe of gargoyles abides in a region of ruins or buildings, the more its members come to resemble that region's architectural styles. The changes a gargoyle's appearance undergoes are slow and subtle, but over the course of years, it can shift radically.  One unusual variant of gargoyle dwells not amid buildings and ruins but under the waves of the sea. These creatures are known as kapoacinths-they have the same basic statistics as normal gargoyles, save that they have the aquatic subtype and their wings grant them a swim speed of 60 feet (but are useless for actual flight). Kapoacinths dwell in shallow, coastal regions where they can shamble up from the surf to prey on those that reside there. They are more likely to form wings, as kapoacinths prefer group living to a solitary lifestyle.","<link rel=""stylesheet""href=""PF.css""><div><h2>Gargoyle</h2><h3><i>Seemingly carved from a dark gray stone, this sinister crouching humanoid resembles a horned, winged demon.</i></h3><br></br></div><div class=""heading""><p class=""alignleft"">Gargoyle</p><p class=""alignright"">CR 4</p><div style=""clear: both;""></div></div><div><h5><b>XP </b>1,200</h5><h5>CE Medium monstrous humanoid (earth)</h5><h5><b>Init </b>+6; <b>Senses </b>darkvision 60 ft.; Perception +5</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>DEFENSE</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>AC </b>16, touch 12, flat-footed 14 (+2 Dex, +4 natural)</h5><h5><b>hp </b>42 (5d10+15)</h5><h5><b>Fort </b>+4, <b>Ref </b>+6, <b>Will </b>+4</h5><h5><b>DR </b>10/magic</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>OFFENSE</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Spd </b>40 ft., fly 60 ft.

The ghorazagh loses its Dexterity bonus to AC, its limbs invading its target's body and each tentacle dealing damage each round. A ghorazagh has a +10 racial bonus to maintain this grapple on a foe once it is attached.

A slowed creature struck by a ghorazagh's bloodspray a second time must make an additional save or be paralyzed. These effects last for 2d6 rounds. Neutralize poison and remove disease have no affect on this effect, though freedom of movement removes the effect. A ghorazagh can also consciously alter its enzymes, producing a spray that removes the effects of this ability. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Chemical Sense (Ex) Ghorazaghs at rest in their hive structures can communicate chemically with all other ghorazagh's attached to the same structure. This is a silent and nearly instantaneous mode of communication that only ghorazaghs understand.","Ghorazaghs-or gore weavers-float like tumorous specters through the depths of Orv, the deepest, most alien cavities of the Darklands, preying upon the wretched vermin of those nighted abysses. Cunning, with minds and drives unknowable and obscene to those of lands above, the gore weavers only recently became aware of the fertility and bounty of the surface world and slowly turn their ebon eyes upward.  When last the ghorazaghs gazed upon Golarion's surface, they found but a wasteland scoured by cosmic flame and blasted by cataclysmic weather. Retreating to their vast vault-hive of Orlvagras, far below Casmaron, they sealed themselves within their realm, desiring to protect themselves against the ruin above. Ever since, they have brooded and warred among themselves, slowly depleting their lands of space and food. With the passage of another age, the ghorazaghs would have likely perished in the belly of the earth-mistakenly believing themselves the waning masters of a rotting world-had Aroden not died.  Detecting shifting and great happenings in the realms above, curious ghorazaghs ventured forth from their prison empire, and for the first time in ages discovered things greater than their homeland's herds of blood worms, things that thought and screamed and sated the terrors' ancient hungers. Carefully, they prowled farther from the absolute depths, discovering tribes of charda, ghoul enclaves, and the frontiers of drow lands, heedful not to reveal themselves yet quick to gorge upon these strange new creatures and drag survivors back to their expanding hives. Although few ghorazaghs currently venture from Orlvagras, already these vanguards have paved the ways for daring hive lords to spread new colonies beyond their land's heart. And among the deepest-dwelling races of the Darklands, dreadful rumors arise of hungry eyes rising from abysses thought to be bottomless, and great maws that devour all they discover.  A ghorazagh's body is roughly spherical, measuring 9 feet in diameter, yet weighs merely 250 pounds. Heavily armored ghorazagh brood guards typically grow to 13 feet in diameter and weigh over 400 pounds, while the rarely glimpsed hive lords are rumored to be truly monstrous abominations of living brain matter and thirsty veins.  Ecology Eerie hunters of the eternal night, ghorazaghs possess a physiology unique-some even say alien-from all other beings on Golarion. Deadly creatures with a highly efficient digestive system, they prove capable of digesting nearly any organic material, producing no waste regardless of how much they consume. However, the bulbous predators prove incapable of digesting blood. While all other digestible materials are processed in the creatures' five tube-like stomachs (with inedible substances merely being vomited forth), blood is strained and stored in flexible chambers attached to the creatures' gnawing, leech-like tentacles. A ghorazagh can store blood for long periods of time, their bodies emitting enzymes that allow them to manipulate the consistency of such fluid. When one wishes, it may expel measures of stored gore through its tentacles along with these enzymes, producing a variety of effects. Most notoriously, ghorazaghs are known to violently expel a slurry of chemical-infused blood that, should it strike living creatures, invades flesh and acts upon a victim's circulation, making the creature sluggish or even paralyzing it. The gore weavers may also excrete blood and bonding chemicals with incredible dexterity, causing blood to congeal into an unnerving scabrous material as hard as stone. Such grisly structures ghorazaghs fashion expertly, forming vast hives and sanguine tunnels within their claimed domains.  In realms overrun by ghorazaghs, the gore weavers create perverse, unbelievable structures: clotted cysts and viscous walls of blood seemingly raised from the depths of the Abyss itself. Threaded with vein-like ducts of flowing gore, these pulsing hives teem with a perverse kind of half-life.  Within their grotesque fastnesses, ghorazaghs settle into individual-sized pools of plasma linked with those running throughout the structure. More than mere resting places, these nodes allow ghorazaghs to draw the blood pulsing through a structure into their bodies and expel it forth.  In effect, each resident becomes a living heart within the hive. Yet the blood within a ghorazagh hive serves merely as a medium for the creatures' complex bodily enzymes. Each gore weaver within the hive can detect messages emanating from the unique chemicals of its kin just as humanoids might recognize words and one's particular voice. Thus, information passes swiftly through these ghastly structures, efficiently alerting those resting within to danger or the orders of the ruling hive lords.  Habitat & Society Native to the eldritch depths of Orv, ghorazaghs know nothing of light or sky, and little of the creatures who call the surface realm home. In the sweltering depths of the Darklands, they prey upon beasts that claw and writhe, masters of reaches of the earth called wastelands by even the most tenacious denizens of the endless night. Capable of finding sustenance among even the meanest vermin, ghorazaghs see prey in all things that grow and move, making no distinction between blind worms, cave fungi, and shrieking humanoids.  Along the edges of impossible abysses, upon the jagged ceilings of vast vaults, and spilling across the broken floors of sprawling caverns, ghorazaghs raise grotesque, scabrous complexes, more half-living organs than anything other races might call cities. Using their abilities to manipulate gore, these bloated aberrations raise cyst-like citadels as communal shelters, enclosures for food, and defenses against the Darklands' many dangers. Each hive obeys the commands of a ghorazagh hive lord, a massive, hermaphroditic creature that serves as the progenitor, racial memory, and living will of the community. Beneath such titans, clot-armored brood guards defend their lord and hive, while lesser ghorazaghs serve as drones, collecting food, expanding the hive, and seeking out new creatures to dissect, understand, and taste before relating their discoveries to the greater hive. The entire hive acts as a perverse collective venture, almost insectile in basic structure though possessed of a curiosity, ingenuity, and ravenous nature that drives ghorazaghs to seek either mastery over or destruction of all things they encounter.","<link rel=""stylesheet""href=""PF.css""><div><h2>Ghorazagh</h2><h3><i>A globular mass of oozing carapace and thick, weeping tentacles floats unnaturally through open space.

Cunning, with minds and drives unknowable and obscene to those of lands above, the gore weavers only recently became aware of the fertility and bounty of the surface world and slowly turn their ebon eyes upward.</p><p>When last the ghorazaghs gazed upon Golarion's surface, they found but a wasteland scoured by cosmic flame and blasted by cataclysmic weather. Retreating to their vast vault-hive of Orlvagras, far below Casmaron, they sealed themselves within their realm, desiring to protect themselves against the ruin above. Ever since, they have brooded and warred among themselves, slowly depleting their lands of space and food. With the passage of another age, the ghorazaghs would have likely perished in the belly of the earth-mistakenly believing themselves the waning masters of a rotting world-had Aroden not died.</p><p>Detecting shifting and great happenings in the realms above, curious ghorazaghs ventured forth from their prison empire, and for the first time in ages discovered things greater than their homeland's herds of blood worms, things that thought and screamed and sated the terrors' ancient hungers. Carefully, they prowled farther from the absolute depths, discovering tribes of charda, ghoul enclaves, and the frontiers of drow lands, heedful not to reveal themselves yet quick to gorge upon these strange new creatures and drag survivors back to their expanding hives. Although few ghorazaghs currently venture from Orlvagras, already these vanguards have paved the ways for daring hive lords to spread new colonies beyond their land's heart. And among the deepest-dwelling races of the Darklands, dreadful rumors arise of hungry eyes rising from abysses thought to be bottomless, and great maws that devour all they discover.</p><p>A ghorazagh's body is roughly spherical, measuring 9 feet in diameter, yet weighs merely 250 pounds. Heavily armored ghorazagh brood guards typically grow to 13 feet in diameter and weigh over 400 pounds, while the rarely glimpsed hive lords are rumored to be truly monstrous abominations of living brain matter and thirsty veins.<b></p><p>Ecology</b><br></br> Eerie hunters of the eternal night, ghorazaghs possess a physiology unique-some even say alien-from all other beings on Golarion. Deadly creatures with a highly efficient digestive system, they prove capable of digesting nearly any organic material, producing no waste regardless of how much they consume. However, the bulbous predators prove incapable of digesting blood. While all other digestible materials are processed in the creatures' five tube-like stomachs (with inedible substances merely being vomited forth), blood is strained and stored in flexible chambers attached to the creatures' gnawing, leech-like tentacles. A ghorazagh can store blood for long periods of time, their bodies emitting enzymes that allow them to manipulate the consistency of such fluid. When one wishes, it may expel measures of stored gore through its tentacles along with these enzymes, producing a variety of effects. Most notoriously, ghorazaghs are known to violently expel a slurry of chemical-infused blood that, should it strike living creatures, invades flesh and acts upon a victim's circulation, making the creature sluggish or even paralyzing it.

Such beings are in eternal anguish, lacking in substance and unable to set things right. Although ghosts can be any alignment, the majority cling to the living world out of a powerful sense of rage and hatred, and as a result are chaotic evil-even the ghost of a good or lawful creature can become hateful and cruel in its afterlife. More than most of the monsters in this book, a ghost benefits from a strong and detailed backstory. Why did this character become a ghost? What are the legends surrounding the ghost? An encounter with a ghost should never happen completely out of the blue-there are plenty of other incorporeal undead like wraiths and spectres to fill that role. A proper encounter with a ghost should be a climactic scene after a lengthy period of tension building with lesser minions or manifestations of the undead spirit. The sample ghost above is that of a human princess who was murdered by an unfaithful lover-after she confronted him, he murdered her by wrapping her in chains and throwing her into the castle well, where she drowned. The ghost's abilities were selected to fit this backstory, and it shows how potent a villain you can create with a simple NPC class. Applying the template to creatures with class levels or creatures with significant racial abilities can create even more powerful ghosts. When a ghost is created, it retains incorporeal ""copies"" of any items that it particularly valued in life (provided the originals are not in another creature's possession). The equipment works normally for the ghost but passes harmlessly through material objects or creatures. A weapon of +1 or better magical enhancement, however, can harm material creatures, but any such attack deals only half as much damage (50%) unless it is a ghost touch weapon. A ghost can use shields or armor only if they have the ghost touch quality. The original items remain behind, just as the ghost's physical remains do. If another creature seizes the original, the incorporeal copy fades away. This loss invariably angers the ghost, who stops at nothing to return the item to its original resting place (and thus regain the item's use). Creating a Ghost ""Ghost"" is an acquired template that can be added to any living creature that has a Charisma score of at least 6. A ghost retains all the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here. Challenge Rating: Same as the base creature +2. Type: The creature's type changes to undead. Do not recalculate the creature's base attack bonus, saves, or skill points. It gains the incorporeal subtype. Armor Class: A ghost gains a def lection bonus equal to its Charisma modifier. It loses the base creature's natural armor bonus, as well as all armor and shield bonuses not from force effects or ghost touch items. Hit Dice: Change all of the creature's racial Hit Dice to d8s. All Hit Dice derived from class levels remain unchanged. Ghosts use their Charisma modifiers to determine bonus hit points (instead of Constitution). Defensive Abilities: A ghost retains all of the defensive abilities of the base creature save those that rely on a corporeal form to function. Ghosts gain channel resistance +4, darkvision 60 ft., the incorporeal ability, and all of the immunities granted by its undead traits. Ghosts also gain the rejuvenation ability. Rejuvenation (Su): In most cases, it's difficult to destroy a ghost through simple combat: the ""destroyed"" spirit restores itself in 2d4 days. Even the most powerful spells are usually only temporary solutions. The only way to permanently destroy a ghost is to determine the reason for its existence and set right whatever prevents it from resting in peace. The exact means varies with each spirit and may require a good deal of research, and should be created specifically for each different ghost by the GM. Speed: Ghosts lose their previous speeds and gain a fly speed of 30 feet (perfect), unless the base creature has a higher fly speed. Melee and Ranged Attacks: A ghost loses all of the base creature's attacks. If it could wield weapons in life, it can wield ghost touch weapons as a ghost. Special Attacks: A ghost retains all the special attacks of the base creature, but any relying on physical contact do not function. In addition, a ghost gains one ghost special attack from the list below for every 3 points of CR (minimum 1-the first ability chosen must always be corrupting touch). The save DC against a ghost's special attack is equal to 10 + 1/2 ghost's HD + ghost's Charisma modifier unless otherwise noted. Additional ghost abilities beyond these can be designed at the GM's discretion. Corrupting Gaze (Su): The ghost is disfigured through age or violence, and has a gaze attack with a range of 30 feet that causes 2d10 damage and 1d4 Charisma damage (Fortitude save negates Charisma damage but not physical damage). Corrupting Touch (Su): All ghosts gain this incorporeal touch attack. By passing part of its incorporeal body through a foe's body as a standard action, the ghost inf licts a number of d6s equal to its CR in damage. This damage is not negative energy-it manifests in the form of physical wounds and aches from supernatural aging. Creatures immune to magical aging are immune to this damage, but otherwise the damage bypasses all forms of damage reduction. A Fortitude save halves the damage inf licted. Draining Touch (Su): The ghost died while insane or diseased. It gains a touch attack that drains 1d4 points from any one ability score it selects on a hit. On each such successful attack, the ghost heals 5 points of damage to itself. When a ghost makes a draining touch attack, it cannot use its standard ghostly touch attack. Frightful Moan (Su): The ghost died in the throes of crippling terror. It can emit a frightful moan as a standard action. All living creatures within a 30-foot spread must succeed on a Will save or become panicked for 2d4 rounds. This is a sonic mind-affecting fear effect. A creature that successfully saves against the moan cannot be affected by the same ghost's moan for 24 hours. Malevolence (Su): The ghost's jealousy of the living is particularly potent. Once per round, the ghost can merge its body with a creature on the Material Plane. This ability is similar to a magic jar spell (caster level 10th or the ghost's Hit Dice, whichever is higher), except that it does not require a receptacle. To use this ability, the ghost must be adjacent to the target. The target can resist the attack with a successful Will save. A creature that successfully saves is immune to that same ghost's malevolence for 24 hours. Telekinesis (Su): The ghost's death involved great physical trauma. The ghost can use telekinesis as a standard action once every 1d4 rounds (caster level 12th or equal to the ghost's HD, whichever is higher). Abilities: Cha +4; as an incorporeal undead creature, a ghost has no Strength or Constitution score. Skills: Ghosts have a +8 racial bonus on Perception and Stealth skill checks. A ghost always treats Climb, Disguise, Fly, Intimidate, Knowledge (arcana), Knowledge (religion), Perception, Sense Motive, Spellcraft, and Stealth as class skills. Otherwise, skills are the same as the base creature.","<link rel=""stylesheet""href=""PF.css""><div><h2>Ghost</h2><h3><i>This spectral, horrifying figure glides silently through the air, passing through solid objects as if they didn't exist.</i></h3><br></br></div><div class=""heading""><p class=""alignleft"">Ghost</p><p class=""alignright"">CR 7</p><div style=""clear: both;""></div></div><div><h5><b>XP </b>3,200</h5><h5>Human ghost aristocrat 7</h5><h5>CE Medium undead (augmented humanoid, incorporeal)</h5><h5><b>Init </b>+5; <b>Senses </b>darkvision 60 ft.; Perception +18</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>DEFENSE</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>AC </b>17, touch 17, flat-footed 15 (+1 Dex, +1 dodge, +5 deflection)</h5><h5><b>hp </b>73 (7d8+42)</h5><h5><b>Fort </b>+7, <b>Ref </b>+6, <b>Will </b>+7</h5><h5><b>Defensive Abilities </b>channel resistance +4, incorporeal, rejuvenation; <b>Immune </b>undead traits</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>OFFENSE</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Spd </b>fly 30 ft.

Several stalks are horribly mobile, each ending in a set of green, toothy jaws.",Flytrap,PFRPG Bestiary,0,"Engulf (Ex) If a giant flytrap begins its turn with an opponent at least two size categories smaller than itself grappled in one of its mouths, it can close its jaws completely around the foe by making a new combat maneuver check (as though attempting to pin the foe). If it succeeds, it engulfs the prey and inflicts 1d8+7 points of damage and 2d6 acid damage as the cavity floods with digestive enzymes.  The seal formed is airtight, so an engulfed creature risks suffocation. Engulf is a special form of pinning, and an engulfed creature can escape in the same way as he can from being pinned, but since an engulfed creature is contained wholly inside the plant's jaws, the flytrap's victim cannot be targeted by effects or attacks that require line of sight or line of effect. A giant flytrap that is grappling or pinning a foe cannot attack other targets with that bite, but is not otherwise hindered.","A hardy plant that grows in areas with poor soil but abundant animal life, this dangerous predator is an immense version of its more common (and much smaller) kin. Whereas the smaller flytraps supplement their growth by catching insects, the giant flytrap does the same with animals, humanoids, and anything else foolish enough to draw too near. Local legends call this plant names like ""mancatcher,"" ""snapperjaw plant,"" ""dragonleaf plant,"" ""cowbiter,"" and ""green gulper,"" but adventurers know it simply as the giant flytrap.  As the giant flytrap's prey are generally much smarter than insects, this huge plant has evolved into a much more aggressive hunter than its smaller brethren. It can lumber slowly along the ground, using its writhing roots like tentacles to relocate to more populous hunting grounds, and is quite canny at blending in with the surrounding foliage. A giant flytrap's jaws and stalks are swift-moving-it reaches out and snaps at passersby with lightning speed. The plant itself even has a modicum of intelligence, and is capable of limited tactical choices, such as knowing when to break off an attack against a powerful foe.  While most giant flytraps have four sets of jaws, some can have as few as one, and others eight or more.  As a general rule, you should increase a giant flytrap's HD by 2 and its natural armor bonus by +1 for each additional bite attack you give it, increasing its CR by +1 for each time you increase its attacks and HD in this manner. If you increase the plant by more than 3 or 4 bites (and thus by more than 6 or 8 Hit Dice), consult Table 1-1 on page 291 to make sure that the plant's CR remains appropriate.

If it succeeds, it engulfs the prey and inflicts 1d8+7 points of damage and 2d6 acid damage as the cavity floods with digestive enzymes.  The seal formed is airtight, so an engulfed creature risks suffocation. Engulf is a special form of pinning, and an engulfed creature can escape in the same way as he can from being pinned, but since an engulfed creature is contained wholly inside the plant's jaws, the flytrap's victim cannot be targeted by effects or attacks that require line of sight or line of effect. A giant flytrap that is grappling or pinning a foe cannot attack other targets with that bite, but is not otherwise hindered.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p>A hardy plant that grows in areas with poor soil but abundant animal life, this dangerous predator is an immense version of its more common (and much smaller) kin. Whereas the smaller flytraps supplement their growth by catching insects, the giant flytrap does the same with animals, humanoids, and anything else foolish enough to draw too near. Local legends call this plant names like ""mancatcher,"" ""snapperjaw plant,"" ""dragonleaf plant,"" ""cowbiter,"" and ""green gulper,"" but adventurers know it simply as the giant flytrap.</p><p>As the giant flytrap's prey are generally much smarter than insects, this huge plant has evolved into a much more aggressive hunter than its smaller brethren. It can lumber slowly along the ground, using its writhing roots like tentacles to relocate to more populous hunting grounds, and is quite canny at blending in with the surrounding foliage. A giant flytrap's jaws and stalks are swift-moving-it reaches out and snaps at passersby with lightning speed. The plant itself even has a modicum of intelligence, and is capable of limited tactical choices, such as knowing when to break off an attack against a powerful foe.</p><p>While most giant flytraps have four sets of jaws, some can have as few as one, and others eight or more.</p><p>As a general rule, you should increase a giant flytrap's HD by 2 and its natural armor bonus by +1 for each additional bite attack you give it, increasing its CR by +1 for each time you increase its attacks and HD in this manner. If you increase the plant by more than 3 or 4 bites (and thus by more than 6 or 8 Hit Dice), consult Table 1-1 on page 291 to make sure that the plant's CR remains appropriate.</p><p>A giant flytrap's stalks are 20 feet long, but generally sprawl relatively close to the central mass-a set of full-grown flytrap jaws is 7 feet across.

The save DC is Constitution-based.","Sometimes a rot grub's transformation into an adult simply fails to trigger. In this case, the mutant grub continues to feed and grow, eventually reaching its maximum size and becoming a venomous giant rot grub. At this size, the rot grub ceases its parasitic behavior and functions more like a predator, scouring the region for living creatures to feed upon. Although it proves notoriously difficult to predict what circumstances might lead to the growth of a giant rot grub, many seem to arise from swarms allowed to feed upon the flesh of dragons, be they true wyrms or other breeds. While these giants can't be trusted to arise from every draconic meal a rot grub swarm ingests, the frequency with which they do proves statistically higher. Rot Grubs as Hazards (CR 4) Smaller groups of normal-sized rot grubs do not constitute a swarm, but even individually they're quite dangerous. Generally, a handful of the grubs infest a single corpse at a time, and a DC 15 Perception check is enough to note the infestation before the grubs have a chance to attack anything living that comes in contact with the corpse. If the Perception check is failed, 1d6 grubs swiftly burst from the carcass to burrow into the creature, which can attempt a DC 15 Ref lex save to avoid the grubs (but only if the creature is aware of the grubs' presence). Once rot grubs are burrowing in a living body, the host must make a DC 17 Fortitude save each round. Failure results in 2 points of Constitution damage per grub infesting the victim-at Constitution 0, the rot grubs have reached the host's heart, brain, and other key internal organs and death occurs. On the first round of infestation, applying flame to the point of entry can kill the grubs and save the host, but this inflicts 1d6 points of fire damage to the victim. Cutting the grubs out also works, but the longer the grubs remain in a host, the more damage this method does. For each round that the grubs have remained in a host, cutting them out requires a slashing weapon and a DC 20 Heal check, and inflicts 1d6 points of damage per round that the host has been infested. On a successful Heal check, the grubs are removed. A remove disease spell (or similar effect) instantly halts the infestation, but as the grubs themselves are parasites, immunity to disease offers no protection against infestation. Any amount of damage reduction is enough to provide immunity to infestation, however. Infested Undead Since rot grubs only feed on living flesh and use dead flesh as an incubator, undead are not harmed by infestations of the parasites. A corporeal, non-skeletal undead infested with rot grubs transfers one rot grub to any creature that touches it or to any creature it strikes with a touch attack or with any natural attack. The target may make a DC 15 Reflex save to avoid being infested, but otherwise is immediately subjected to a single grub burrowing through his flesh.

The save DC is Constitutuion-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.,"Giant scorpions are monstrous versions of the more common desert scorpion. They are likely to attack any creature that approaches. Giant scorpions usually charge when attacking, grabbing prey in their pincers, then lashing their segmented tails forward to kill their victim with injected venom. Giant scorpions are just over 8 feet long from head to the base of the tail; the tail adds an additional 8 feet or so, although it is usually curled up over the scorpion's back. Giant scorpions weigh between 2,000 and 6,000 pounds. Giant scorpions normally feed on other giant vermin, as well as large mammals that they paralyze with their venom, but they will attack and eat any living creature that ventures too close. In turn, giant scorpions are preyed upon by purple worms and other large predators. Giant scorpions engage in complex courtship rituals when they mate, grasping each other's pincers, arching their tails, and performing a circular ""dance."" Soon after mating, the male usually retreats to avoid being cannibalized by the female. Female scorpions do not lay eggs; they give birth to live young in broods of a dozen or so. The mother carries her brood on her back until the young are old enough to fend for themselves and hunt their own prey. Giant scorpions live in underground burrows, either as solitary hunters or in small colonies, and will sometimes take up residence in man-made ruins or dungeons if food is plentiful. Giant scorpion colonies are usually made up of scorpions from the same brood that have yet to strike out on their own. Other species of scorpions exist as well, some smaller but most quite a bit larger and favoring different terrains, such as forests, plains, or even underground.

A giant stymphalides can use this attack a number of time per day equal to its Constitution modifier.","Man-eating birds of prey, the rare creatures known as stymphalides stalk the arid plains and coastlines of Golarion in ravenous swarms, shredding warm-blooded animals and unwary travelers with their bladed feathers and dagger-like beaks. From a distance, stymphalides might easily be mistaken for cranes, ibises, or other longnecked birds, though in full sunlight their gleaming feathers and the haze of blood lingering from past meals are impossible to mistake. Peculiarly, the feathers and beak of a stymphalides are made of steel, similar to the metallic hide of a gorgon. The wings of stymphalides are as sharp as knives and often lacerate their prey as the birds swarm and beat their wings against their unfortunate victims' skin. Similarly, their beaks are supernaturally sharp and can pierce the tough hides of animal prey or the armor of those warriors foolish enough to hunt the creatures. Even if a victim of a stymphalides swarm's frenzied attacks manages to fend off the vicious creatures, the wounds caused by the birds continue to bleed long after being inflicted, and the victim often perishes from loss of blood before ever reaching help. Most stymphalides stand approximately 2-1/2 feet tall and weigh little more than 40 pounds. Although mean-tempered and territorial, lone stymphalides prove relatively harmless, thus traveling in swarms of several dozen, relying on strength of numbers to bring down large or dangerous prey. Many tales also tell of enormous breeds of these monstrous birds, powerful enough to prey upon wyverns. These giant stymphalides are said to grow up to 13 feet tall and weigh over 250 pounds, with wingspans reaching upward of 25 feet. Such gigantic stymphalides are rarely seen, preferring to lurk upon desolate cliffs or even amid harsh extraplanar realms. Ecology Unlike vultures and other birds of the deserts and plains, stymphalides do not scavenge carcasses, although they are not above driving away natural scavengers if a large, fresh kill looks particularly inviting. When traveling in flocks, stymphalides prove fearless predators, swooping in and swarming any creature that wanders into their territory. The birds actively hunt their prey, harrying and killing lone individuals or stragglers. The attacks of a stymphalides swarm often prove so vicious that the creatures can take to flight once they have wounded prey, wait for it to bleed to death, and return to pick the corpse clean. Stymphalides generally avoid attacking large groups of people, unless the birds have gathered in a particularly sizable flock. Stymphalides are not purely carnivorous. A lone stymphalides might resort to eating fruit and other plants if it is separated from its flock or food is scarce, and orchards and fields of crops have been devastated by stymphalides when great swarms of the birds, starving from overpopulation or lack of prey, migrate to new territories. Yet although the birds are omnivorous, they seem to prefer meat. Those plainsfolk or desert-dwellers whose livelihoods depend on livestock have learned to fear the sight of flocks of birds silhouetted against the sky, as herds of cattle and other grazing animals have been ravaged by their swarms. Habitat & Society Most swarms of stymphalides roost near watering holes, rivers, and coastal cliffs, preying upon unfortunate creatures desperate enough to seek food or water so near to the dangerous birds' nests. The nests of stymphalides are frequently made from the bones of the creatures' prey, piled into macabre ziggurats upon which entire flocks of the birds rest. Particularly large flocks of the birds construct enormous nests, and giant stymphalides can create towers visible for miles. When not at rest, flocks of the creatures soar high on warm currents of air, relying upon their keen eyesight to spot suitable prey far below. Because of their voracious appetites, flocks of stymphalides must claim a vast swath of territory to maintain their feeding habits. Stymphalides are fiercely territorial, and flocks of the birds frequently fight with one another in swooping aerial battles to determine possession of land. Fortunately for the folk of civilized lands, stymphalides rarely encroach upon areas well traveled by humanoids and other creatures clever enough to bring down one of these metal-winged avians. Among the people of the plains, the metallic birds are often regarded as nearly legendary creatures. Stymphalides breed at an astonishing rate, however, and overpopulation and exhaustion of game frequently force extraordinarily large and deadly groups of the creatures to band together in search of new lands and new prey to devour.","<link rel=""stylesheet""href=""PF.css""><div><h2>Stymphalidies, Giant</h2><h3><i>Every feather like a plate of shimmering armor and its beak the length and sharpness of a knight's lance, this towering, ibis-like bird looks to be sculpted from silver and brass.

It cannot be flanked.  Amorphous (Ex) A gibbering mouther's body is malleable and shapeless. It is immune to precision damage (like sneak attacks) and critical hits, and can move through an area as small as one-quarter its space without squeezing or oneeighth its space when squeezing.  Blood Drain (Ex) On a successful grapple check after grabbing, several of the creature's mouths attach to its target. Each round it maintains its grapple, its mouths automatically deal 1d4 points of bite damage and 1 point of Constitution damage as it drains its victim's blood.  Engulf (Ex) This ability functions as swallow whole, except for the following changes. An engulfed creature is trapped in the gibbering mouther's body, where several of its mouths continue to feed and drain blood. A gibbering mouther can engulf only one foe of its size or smaller at a time. If an engulfed creature cuts its way free (the mouther's damage reduction still applies to those inside), the mouther simply flows together again and can still use its engulf attack.  Gibbering (Su) As a free action, a gibbering mouther can emit a cacophony of maddening sound. All creatures other than gibbering mouthers within 60 feet must succeed on a DC 13 Will save or be confused for 1 round. This is a mindaffecting compulsion insanity effect. A creature that saves cannot be affected by the same mouther's gibbering for 24 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Ground Manipulation (Su) At will as a standard action, a gibbering mouther can cause stone and earth under its body to grow soft and muddy. The ground remains muddy for 1 minute after the mouther moves off of the location.  A gibbering mouther can move through these areas with ease, but other creatures treat them as difficult terrain.  Spittle (Ex) Each round as a free action, a gibbering mouther can emit a stream of acidic spittle at one target within 30 feet. On a successful attack, the target is blinded for 1d4 rounds unless he succeeds on a DC 18 Fortitude save.

It cannot be flanked.</h5><h5><b>  Amorphous (Ex)</b> A gibbering mouther's body is malleable and shapeless. It is immune to precision damage (like sneak attacks) and critical hits, and can move through an area as small as one-quarter its space without squeezing or oneeighth its space when squeezing.</h5><h5><b>  Blood Drain (Ex)</b> On a successful grapple check after grabbing, several of the creature's mouths attach to its target. Each round it maintains its grapple, its mouths automatically deal 1d4 points of bite damage and 1 point of Constitution damage as it drains its victim's blood.</h5><h5><b>  Engulf (Ex)</b> This ability functions as swallow whole, except for the following changes. An engulfed creature is trapped in the gibbering mouther's body, where several of its mouths continue to feed and drain blood. A gibbering mouther can engulf only one foe of its size or smaller at a time. If an engulfed creature cuts its way free (the mouther's damage reduction still applies to those inside), the mouther simply flows together again and can still use its engulf attack.  </h5><h5><b>Gibbering (Su)</b> As a free action, a gibbering mouther can emit a cacophony of maddening sound. All creatures other than gibbering mouthers within 60 feet must succeed on a DC 13 Will save or be confused for 1 round. This is a mindaffecting compulsion insanity effect. A creature that saves cannot be affected by the same mouther's gibbering for 24 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.  </h5><h5><b>Ground Manipulation (Su)</b> At will as a standard action, a gibbering mouther can cause stone and earth under its body to grow soft and muddy. The ground remains muddy for 1 minute after the mouther moves off of the location.  A gibbering mouther can move through these areas with ease, but other creatures treat them as difficult terrain.</h5><h5><b>  Spittle (Ex)</b> Each round as a free action, a gibbering mouther can emit a stream of acidic spittle at one target within 30 feet. On a successful attack, the target is blinded for 1d4 rounds unless he succeeds on a DC 18 Fortitude save.

Very few goblins have the drive to build structures of their own. Coastlines are favored, as goblins are quite fond of sifting through junk and flotsam in an unending quest to find treasures among the refuse of more civilized races. Goblin hatred runs deep, and few things inspire their wrath more than gnomes (who have long fought against goblins), horses (who frighten goblins tremendously), and regular dogs (whom goblins regard as pale imitations of goblin dogs). Goblins are also quite superstitious, and treat magic with a fawning mixture of awe and fear. They have the habit of ascribing magic to the mundane as well, with fire and writing both taking on mystical power in goblin society. Fire is much loved by goblins for its capacity to wreak great destruction and because it doesn't require size or strength to wield, but written words are hated. Goblins believe that writing steals words out of your head, and as a result of this belief, goblins are universally illiterate. Goblins are voracious and can eat their body weight in food daily without growing fat. Goblin lairs always have numerous storerooms and larders. While they prefer human and gnome flesh, a goblin won't turn down any food-except, perhaps, vegetables. Goblin Characters Goblins are defined by their class levels-they do not possess racial Hit Dice. All goblins have the following racial traits. -2 Strength, +4 Dexterity, -2 Charisma: Goblins are fast, but weak and unpleasant to be around. Small: Goblins are Small creatures and gain a +1 size bonus to their AC, a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, a -1 penalty to their CMB and CMD, and a +4 size bonus on Stealth checks. Fast: Goblins are fast for their size, and have a base speed of 30 feet. Darkvision: Goblins can see in the dark up to 60 feet. Skilled: +4 racial bonus on Ride and Stealth checks. Languages: Goblins begin play speaking Goblin. Goblins with high Intelligence scores can choose any of these bonus languages: Common, Draconic, Dwarven, Gnoll, Gnome, Halfling, Orc.","<link rel=""stylesheet""href=""PF.css""><div><h2>Goblin</h2><h3><i>This creature stands barely three feet tall, its scrawny, humanoid body dwarfed by its wide, ungainly head.</i></h3><br></br></div><div class=""heading""><p class=""alignleft"">Goblin</p><p class=""alignright"">CR 1/3</p><div style=""clear: both;""></div></div><div><h5><b>XP </b>135</h5><h5>Goblin warrior 1</h5><h5>NE Small humanoid (goblinoid)</h5><h5><b>Init </b>+6; <b>Senses </b>darkvision 60 ft.; Perception -1</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>DEFENSE</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>AC </b>16, touch 13, flat-footed 14 (+2 armor, +2 Dex, +1 shield, +1 size)</h5><h5><b>hp </b>6 (1d10+1)</h5><h5><b>Fort </b>+3, <b>Ref </b>+2, <b>Will </b>-1</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>OFFENSE</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Spd </b>30 ft.</h5><h5><b>Melee </b>short sword +1 (1d4/19-20)</h5><h5><b>Ranged </b>short bow +3 (1d4/x3)</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>STATISTICS</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Str</b> 11, <b>Dex</b> 15, <b>Con</b> 12, <b>Int</b> 10, <b>Wis</b> 9, <b>Cha</b> 6</h5><h5><b>Base Atk </b>+1; <b>CMB </b>+0; <b>CMD </b>12</h5><h5><b>Feats </b>Improved Initiative</h5><h5><b>Skills </b>Ride +10, Stealth +10, Swim +4; <b>Racial Modifiers </b>+4 Ride, +4 Stealth</h5><h5><b>Languages </b>Goblin</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>ECOLOGY</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Environment </b> temperate forest and plains (usually coastal regions)</h5><h5><b>Organization </b>gang (4-9), warband (10-16 with goblin dog mounts), or tribe (17+ plus 100% noncombatants; 1 sergeant of 3rd level per 20 adults; 1 or 2 lieutenants of 4th or 5th level; 1 leader of 6th-8th level; and 10-40 goblin dogs, wolves, or worgs)</h5><h5><b>Treasure </b>NPC gear (leather armor, light wooden shield, short sword, short bow with 20 arrows, other treasure)</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p>Goblins prefer to dwell in caves, amid large and dense thickets of thistles and brambles, or in structures built and then abandoned by others.

They bear the same weapons and regalia they did in life, though warped or empowered by their profane resurrection. The legions they once held also flock to them in death, ready to serve their wicked ambitions once more. A graveknight's essence is fundamentally tied to its armor, the bloodstained trappings of their battle lust. This armor becomes an icon of their perverse natures, transforming into a monstrous second skin over the husk of desiccated flesh and scarred bone locked within. Creating a Graveknight ""Graveknight"" is an acquired template that can be added to any living creature with 5 or more Hit Dice (referred to hereafter as the base creature). Most graveknights were once humanoids or monstrous humanoids. A graveknight uses the base creature's statistics and abilities except as noted here. CR: Same as base creature +2. Alignment: Any evil. Type: The graveknight's type changes to undead (augmented). Do not recalculate class Hit Dice, BAB, or saves. Senses: A graveknight gains darkvision 60 ft. Aura: A graveknight emanates the following aura. Sacrilegious Aura (Su): A graveknight constantly exudes an aura of intense evil and negative energy in a 30- foot radius. This aura functions as the spell desecrate, which the graveknight constantly gains the benefits of. In addition, this miasma of fell energies hinders the channeling of positive energy. Any creature that attempts to summon positive energy in this area-such as through a cleric's channel energy ability, a paladin's lay on hands, or any spell with the healing descriptor-must make a concentration check with a DC equal to 10 + the graveknight's Hit Dice. If the character fails, the effect is blocked, its number of uses of that ability being reduced by 1 or the spell being lost. Armor Class: Natural armor improves by +4. Hit Dice: Increase all racial Hit Dice to d8s. Class Hit Dice are unaffected. As undead, graveknights use their Charisma modifiers to determine bonus hit points. Defensive Abilities: A graveknight gains channel resistance +4; DR 10/magic; and immunity to cold, electricity, and any additional energy type noted by its ruinous revivification special quality. A graveknight also gains spell resistance equal to its augmented CR + 11. The graveknight also gains the following abilities. Rejuvenation (Su): One day after a graveknight is destroyed, its armor begins to rebuild the undead warrior's body. This process takes 1d10 days-if the body is destroyed before that time passes, the armor merely starts the process anew. After this time has elapsed, the graveknight wakens fully healed. Attacks: A graveknight gains a slam attack if the base creature didn't have one. Damage for the slam depends on the graveknight's size (see page 302 of the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary). Its natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Special Attacks: A graveknight gains the following special attacks. Save DCs are equal to 10 + 1/2 the graveknight's HD + the graveknight's Cha modifier unless otherwise noted. Channel Destruction (Su): Any weapon a graveknight wields is shrouded in destructive energy, and deals an additional +1d6 points of damage for every 4 Hit Dice the graveknight possesses. This additional damage is of the energy type determined by the ruinous revivification special quality. Devastating Blast (Su): Three times per day the graveknight may unleash a 30-foot cone of destructive force. This blast deals 2d6 points of damage for every 3 Hit Dice a graveknight possesses. Creatures within the area may make a Reflex save for half damage. This damage is of the energy type determined by the graveknight's ruinous revivification special quality. Undead Mastery (Su): As a standard action, a graveknight can attempt to bend any undead creature within 50 feet to its will. The targeted undead must make a successful Will save or fall under the graveknight's control. This control is permanent for unintelligent undead, while undead with Intelligence scores are allowed an additional save every day to break free from the graveknight's control. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same graveknight's undead mastery for 24 hours. A graveknight can control 5 Hit Dice worth of undead creatures for every Hit Die it possesses. If the graveknight exceeds this number, it loses control over some of its minions, as per the spell animate dead. Special Qualities: A graveknight gains the following special qualities. Phantom Mount (Su): Once per hour, a graveknight can summon a skeletal horse similar to a phantom steed. This mount is more real than a typical phantom steed, and can carry one additional rider. The phantom steed's powers are based on the graveknight's total Hit Dice rather than caster level. A graveknight's mount looks distinctive and always appears the same. If the mount is destroyed, it can be summoned again with full hit points 1 hour later. Ruinous Revivification (Su): At the time of its creation, the graveknight chooses one of the following energy types: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. This energy type should be relevant to the graveknight's life or death, defaulting to fire if none feel appropriate. This energy type influences the effects of several of a graveknight's special abilities. Ability Scores: Str +6, Int +2, Wis +4, Cha +4. As an undead creature, a graveknight has no Constitution score. Skills: Graveknights gain a +8 racial bonus on Intimidate, Perception, and Ride. Feats: Graveknights gain Improved Initiative, Mounted Combat, Ride- By Attack, and Toughness. Graveknight Armor In death, the graveknight's life force lingers on in its armor, not its corpse, in much the same way that a lich's essence is bound within a phylactery. Unless every part of a graveknight's armor is ruined along with its body, a graveknight can rejuvenate after it is destroyed. A typical suit of full plate graveknight armor has hardness 10 and 45 hit points, though armor with enhancements or made of special materials proves more difficult to destroy. Merely breaking a graveknight's armor does not destroy it; it must be utterly annihilated, such as by being melted into slag or sunk into the crushing depths of the sea.","<link rel=""stylesheet""href=""PF.css""><div><h2>Graveknight</h2><h3><i>Darkness and sinister armor gird this powerful figure.

Despite its lack of intelligence, the gray ooze is a most problematic creature due to its transparency. While the ooze cannot easily climb walls or swim, its habit of lurking in the thick mud that lines the banks of marsh pools or lying in harmless-looking pools on dull-colored dungeon floors makes it dangerously easy to overlook and step on. Some sages believe that the gray ooze is the result of a failed alchemical experiment, while others postulate that the first gray oozes spontaneously arose from a cesspit of magical detritus. Of course, these theories that gray oozes are not living organisms, but rather the alchemical result of an unfortunate mixture of rare caustic fluids and magical waste, are derided by many who dwell in areas plagued by the creatures but which do not have a long history of magical pollution. Variant Gray Oozes The gray ooze adapts readily and swiftly to changes in environments, the simple structure of its primeval form and its method of using fission to reproduce all but ensuring that such changes occur. Listed below are two such variants that adventurers have encountered. Crystal Ooze (CR 4): The crystal ooze is an aquatic variant that dwells in deeper waters than most commonly found in the gray ooze's beloved swamps. A crystal ooze has the aquatic subtype and a swim speed of 30 ft. The crystal ooze lacks the gray ooze's constrict ability, but it does secrete a paralytic toxin that causes those whom it strikes to become paralyzed for 3d6 rounds if they fail a Fortitude saving throw (the save DC is Constitution-based). Id Ooze (CR 6): Perhaps the strangest variant gray oozes are those that have developed a rudimentary intelligence, including the ability to communicate telepathically with other oozes, or even the ability to blast enemies with pulses of raw mental power. Id oozes are advanced gray oozes with an Intelligence score of 2 (and thus gain skill ranks and feats-typically 4 ranks in Stealth, Improved Initiative, and Toughness), can communicate basic empathic information with other id oozes within 100 feet via telepathy, and can use lesser confusion at will as a spell-like ability (CL equals the id ooze's HD).","<link rel=""stylesheet""href=""PF.css""><div><h2>Gray Ooze</h2><h3><i>A seemingly mundane puddle, patch of moist stone, or glistening rock is suddenly revealed to be more as a terrible pseudopod lashes out.</i></h3><br></br></div><div class=""heading""><p class=""alignleft"">Gray Ooze</p><p class=""alignright"">CR 4</p><div style=""clear: both;""></div></div><div><h5><b>XP </b>1,200</h5><h5>N Medium ooze </h5><h5><b>Init </b>-5; <b>Senses </b>blindsight 60 ft.; Perception -5</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>DEFENSE</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>AC </b>5, touch 5, flat-footed 5 (-5 Dex)</h5><h5><b>hp </b>50 (4d8+32)</h5><h5><b>Fort </b>+9, <b>Ref </b>-4, <b>Will </b>-4</h5><h5><b>Defensive Abilities </b>ooze traits; <b>Immune </b>cold, fire</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>OFFENSE</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Spd </b>10 ft.</h5><h5><b>Melee </b>slam +6 (1d6+4 plus 1d6 acid and grab)</h5><h5><b>Special Attacks </b>acid, constrict (1d6+1 plus 1d6 acid)</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>STATISTICS</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Str</b> 16, <b>Dex</b> 1, <b>Con</b> 26, <b>Int</b> -, <b>Wis</b> 1, <b>Cha</b> 1</h5><h5><b>Base Atk </b>+3; <b>CMB </b>+6 (+10 grapple); <b>CMD </b>11 (can't be tripped)</h5><h5><b>SQ </b>transparent</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>ECOLOGY</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Environment </b> cold marshes and underground</h5><h5><b>Organization </b>solitary</h5><h5><b>Treasure </b>none</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>SPECIAL ABILITIES</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Acid (Ex)</b> The digestive acid that covers a gray ooze dissolves metals and organic material, but not stone.

Gigantic but dull-witted, these massive savages lurk far from the lands of civilized races, but occasionally either need or fate drives them to rampages from which few are safe. Such undeniable force brings with it a dread that, in many instances, grows to reverence, giving rise to strange cults that cloak these cyclopes amid veils of menace and dark legends. The average great cyclops stands approximately 30 feet tall and weighs upward of 4 tons, though individuals of significantly greater size are known. Ecology Similar in many respects to better-known cyclopes or giants, great cyclopes are primeval titans, seeming throwbacks to a lost age of cyclopean savagery or degenerates from an era of lost wonders. Whatever their origins, great cyclopes bear a brute strength and rough primitiveness lost to their smaller kin. Aside from hide tougher than leather armor and a primal slope to both their posture and brows, each of these giants possesses a thick but short horn that protrudes from the brow. Although difficult to bring to bear in most battles, the horn allows a charging great cyclops to impale its victim with incredible force. While common cyclopes possess the uncanny ability to gaze into the future, great cyclopes lack such lucid insights. Rather, during times of strain and bloodlust, these giants often flash on scenes of even greater violence, which serves to drive their furies even further. This makes them awe-inspiring combatants, capable of causing ruin beyond belief even for beasts of such titanic size. Habitat & Society Denizens of remote and primeval parts of the world, great cyclopes typically dwell in lands where none might intrude upon them-deserted islands, high craggy mountains, and stoic hill countries often provide the great caves they favor as lairs. While most avoid well-traveled or populated lands, spending much of their time hunting megafauna and even monstrous prey in the wilds, some, driven by hunger or a desperation to wander, seek out the paths and settlements of humanoids, finding that their fragile buildings are easily shattered and that the mewling creatures make savory meals. Great cyclopes never voluntarily gather with others of their kind. Violent and selfish, the dangerous giants rarely collect in groups larger than a dozen, which are typically little more than hate-filled gangs organized around a single brutish leader. In such instances, weaker cyclopes hunt and serve their chief 's whims while he spends his time idle. Only fear of the chief keep these communities together-internal violence and even death are common. Such organization is sometimes mirrored by groups in which a lone great cyclops presses its lesser cyclops kin into service. Occasionally, though, the power structure takes on more complex arrangements, with small groups of cyclopes or other humanoids coming to revere great cyclopes, creating entire cults around the might and mystery of such beings. Cyclops Cults Atop the bald crests of shattered hills and before mawlike riffs in mountain walls rise eerily etched rune towers, their pinnacles crowned with great, swirling eye-like symbols and thick chains rooted deep into the rock. During the nights of the full moon, on days when the sun hangs longest in the sky, and during portentous eclipses- all times when the sky seems most watchful of the lands below-the blind, the mad, and the mutilated bring shrieking sacrifices to these terrifying monoliths, climb the ancient, weather-worn stairs, and shackle terrified offerings amid the staring stones risen halfway between the earth and sky. Then comes the blaring of shrill horns and the chanting of words with long-lost meanings, the ancient chorus that summons the great cyclops, demon and god, from his maze-like lair. The ""Adoration of the Eye"" is terrible but short, as the one-eyed titan makes quick work of its feast, rending limbs as it tears the frail flesh from its towering altar, devours the screaming thing, and-swiftly growing bored-wanders back to its den or off upon other depredations. Timidly, the worshipers return to the stones, reading omens in the bloody rivulets snaking down their crudely carved eyes-particularly omens which tell when to return again with a new offering to their bestial god. Who pays homage to cyclopes varies wildly; their cults take wildly different shapes, from the beast tribes of Iobaria to the mystery cults of Iblydos. For some, the worship is all mysticism and superstition, with primitive shamans seeking insights and power from blood, the heavens, and the cyclopes' inscrutable, all-seeing eye. For others, such veneration offers revelations into the lost ways and powers of the cyclopes, revealing and in some rare cases granting a measure of mastery over those forgotten secrets. Still others merely cloak their own cruelties and ambitions in the cloak of faith, drawing influence and might from false ceremonies and the favor of brutal giants. Whatever their form, cyclops cults dwell on the mysteries of insight, the future, the heavens, and the symbolic eye. To mimic their figureheads, many followers put out one of their own eyes as proof of their faith, or create-either artistically, surgically, or magically-a symbolic third eye in their forehead. Common cyclopes, many of whom become leaders and favored members of such cults, typically possess no greater insights into the ways or workings of their dubious faith than others but rarely make such failings openly known. Great cyclopes, however, often inadvertently serve as the unifying force of such cults, their great strength and ferocity lending an air of supernatural power to the cult's workings. These monstrous giants rarely have any understanding of the workings of the cult, aside from knowing they receive offerings from it, and might even be unaware that such gifts suggest reverence. Rather, most have a simple relationship with the leader or inner circle of a cult, enforcing the leader's might and occasionally destroying its enemies in return for victims to satiate their own cruel hungers.","<link rel=""stylesheet""href=""PF.css""><div><h2>Cyclops, Great </h2><h3><i><i>The land quivers with every movement of this ferocious titan.

Each time a green hag hits a foe with her claw attack, the victim takes 2 points of Strength damage unless he resists the weakness with a DC 16 Fortitude save. Alternatively, a green hag can attempt to inflict even greater weakness on a foe by making a touch attack-this variant requires a standard action, and cannot be attempted in the same round the hag makes claw attacks. The opponent touched must succeed on a DC 16 Fortitude save or take 2d4 points of Strength damage. The save DC is Charisma-based. Mimicry (Ex) A green hag can imitate the sounds of almost any animal found near its lair.","Terrifying crones known to haunt foul swamps and tangled forests, green hags harbor an intense hatred for all beauty and purity. Making use of their varied deceptive abilities, these crones delight in murdering innocents, unhinging noble minds, and debasing the pure of heart. They are particularly fond of using disguise self to assume the forms of alluring young maidens and then seducing young men away from their lovers or families. In this form, they can infect such noble and upstanding citizens with all manner of debauchery and scandal. Some green hags prefer to reveal their true natures to their lovers at a moment precisely engineered to drive the man mad with horror and shame. Others drag out their dalliances and do what they can to utterly ruin the lives of the men they seduce before showing the broken shell that remains the truth. In the end, the luckiest of these unfortunate lovers end up being eaten by their green hag companions-for the unlucky, their final doom can be much worse, for the cruel imagination of the green hag is vast. A typical green hag stands between 5 and 6 feet tall and weighs just under 160 pounds. Hag Covens When three hags of any type gather, they can form a coven to gain increased magical ability. Any combination of hags can form a coven, but green hags are the most common members of such foul gatherings. Whenever all three hags of a particular coven are within 10 feet of one another, all three of them can work together to use any of the following spell-like abilities: animate dead, baleful polymorph (DC 18), blight (DC 17), bestow curse (DC 17), clairaudience/clairvoyance, charm monster (DC 17), commune, control weather, dream, forcecage, mind blank, mirage arcana (DC 18), reincarnate, speak with dead, veil (DC 19), vision. All three hags must take a fullround action to take part in this form of cooperative magic.

In this form, they can infect such noble and upstanding citizens with all manner of debauchery and scandal. Some green hags prefer to reveal their true natures to their lovers at a moment precisely engineered to drive the man mad with horror and shame. Others drag out their dalliances and do what they can to utterly ruin the lives of the men they seduce before showing the broken shell that remains the truth. In the end, the luckiest of these unfortunate lovers end up being eaten by their green hag companions-for the unlucky, their final doom can be much worse, for the cruel imagination of the green hag is vast.</p><p>A typical green hag stands between 5 and 6 feet tall and weighs just under 160 pounds.</p><p><b>Hag Covens</b><br> When three hags of any type gather, they can form a coven to gain increased magical ability.

Truespeech (Su) The Hand of the Inheritor can speak with any creature that has a language, as though using a tongues spell (caster level equal to angel's Hit Dice). This ability is always active.","The Hand of the Inheritor is a warrior angel, first to answer Iomedae's call whenever she must directly intervene on Golarion. As fast as the greatest angels, he leads the charge when her celestial armies must go to war. A veteran of countless sorties into the Abyss, the Hand fights with a song of battle on his lips and unbreakable courage in his heart. He looks like a tall, golden-skinned angel with a halo of sword-like blades, which he can also wear on his arm like a spiked shield. He may manifest or hide a pair of feathered wings at will, which may be any color, though he does not actually need them to fly. The Hand is not a diplomatic angel, and Iomedae rarely calls upon him when the situation requires someone willing to mince words. He once served the Empyreal Lord Ragathiel (at which time he was called the Hand of Vengeance) but asked to serve Iomedae after Aroden died, as she needed a hero to be her champion. Ecology The Hand of the Inheritor does not need to eat or sleep, though he is known to take a long pause after a great battle to think about fallen comrades with other veterans. He refers to Iomedae as ""My Lady, the Just Queen of Heaven,"" and treats her as if he were a knight holding a chaste adoration for a righteous courtly lady. His haloshield is called the Brightsword, and he sometimes refers to it as if it were an independent being, though it acts according to his will; as a free action he can pull a +2 longsword from the halo-shield at any time and wield it as a weapon, though the sword vanishes if ever separated from him. Habitat & Society The angel focuses on honorable combat, the preservation of just rulers, and valorous deeds. When he is not needed on Golarion, he guards noble souls through the Astral to Pharasma's court, patrols the borders of Iomedae's realm in search of abominations from the Abyss, duels devils on neutral ground to better learn their tactics, and watches over youths his patron has marked for greatness. He enjoys battle hymns and marching music, though his voice is more suited for harmonizing with a true performer than leading a song. He is adept at determining if a rampaging monster intends evil or if it is merely hungry, and is merciful enough to only slay the ones intending to do wrong. Likewise, he feels no guilt in slaying those who embrace evil, but strikes to subdue when his opponent is magically controlled or otherwise compromised in his decision-making. Though he is actually older than Iomedae, he defers to her divine wisdom and experience as a mortal, for he understands his perspective as an immortal angel living in the realms beyond Golarion is very different and sometimes emotionally distant from the thoughts and concerns of humanity. He is an ally of the heralds of Sarenrae and Shelyn, but is wary of the herald of Cayden Cailen, for that one's overt sexuality makes him slightly uncomfortable (as he spent thousands of years serving the Empyreal Lord of chastity). Heralds of the Gods: Revisited The Hand of the Inheritor stands among a special class of unique, godly servants known as heralds. With few exceptions, every one of Golarion's deities has its own herald, a favored minion that serves as a messenger and emissary throughout the planes and upon the mortal realm. While not necessarily the most powerful of a deity's minions, heralds embody fundamental elements of a god's faiths and philosophies, and thus prove particularly suited to interactions with mortal worshipers-although a herald appears only at the direct order of a deity, not merely because a powerful cleric requires aid. Thus, heralds are creatures myth, and their appearances mark lives and events of legend. In the Pathfinder RPG, heralds are unique outsiders of approximately CR 15 with 18 or fewer Hit Dice, making them available for summons via the spell greater planar ally. Only a deity's worshipers can summon its herald; thus, even the most powerful worshiper of Sarenrae can never summon the Hand of the Inheritor. In addition, only divine spellcasters can summon heralds, preventing arcane casters and spells like planar binding from effectively calling upon such beings. Even if a character proves powerful enough to call out to a herald, a deity has the final say in whether or not its emissary answers a worshiper's summons, granting its herald's service only to followers in the most extreme need or whose acts directly further its will. Currently, the statistics for eight heralds have appeared in Pathfinder Adventure Paths, while all of these divine emissaries are described in Pathfinder Chronicles: Gods & Magic.

As fast as the greatest angels, he leads the charge when her celestial armies must go to war. A veteran of countless sorties into the Abyss, the Hand fights with a song of battle on his lips and unbreakable courage in his heart. He looks like a tall, golden-skinned angel with a halo of sword-like blades, which he can also wear on his arm like a spiked shield. He may manifest or hide a pair of feathered wings at will, which may be any color, though he does not actually need them to fly.</p><p>The Hand is not a diplomatic angel, and Iomedae rarely calls upon him when the situation requires someone willing to mince words. He once served the Empyreal Lord Ragathiel (at which time he was called the Hand of Vengeance) but asked to serve Iomedae after Aroden died, as she needed a hero to be her champion.</p><p><b>Ecology</b><br> The Hand of the Inheritor does not need to eat or sleep, though he is known to take a long pause after a great battle to think about fallen comrades with other veterans.</p><p>He refers to Iomedae as ""My Lady, the Just Queen of Heaven,"" and treats her as if he were a knight holding a chaste adoration for a righteous courtly lady. His haloshield is called the Brightsword, and he sometimes refers to it as if it were an independent being, though it acts according to his will; as a free action he can pull a +2 longsword from the halo-shield at any time and wield it as a weapon, though the sword vanishes if ever separated from him.</p><p><b>Habitat & Society</b><br> The angel focuses on honorable combat, the preservation of just rulers, and valorous deeds. When he is not needed on Golarion, he guards noble souls through the Astral to Pharasma's court, patrols the borders of Iomedae's realm in search of abominations from the Abyss, duels devils on neutral ground to better learn their tactics, and watches over youths his patron has marked for greatness.</p><p>He enjoys battle hymns and marching music, though his voice is more suited for harmonizing with a true performer than leading a song. He is adept at determining if a rampaging monster intends evil or if it is merely hungry, and is merciful enough to only slay the ones intending to do wrong. Likewise, he feels no guilt in slaying those who embrace evil, but strikes to subdue when his opponent is magically controlled or otherwise compromised in his decision-making.</p><p>Though he is actually older than Iomedae, he defers to her divine wisdom and experience as a mortal, for he understands his perspective as an immortal angel living in the realms beyond Golarion is very different and sometimes emotionally distant from the thoughts and concerns of humanity. He is an ally of the heralds of Sarenrae and Shelyn, but is wary of the herald of Cayden Cailen, for that one's overt sexuality makes him slightly uncomfortable (as he spent thousands of years serving the Empyreal Lord of chastity).</p><p><b>Heralds of the Gods: Revisited</b><br> The Hand of the Inheritor stands among a special class of unique, godly servants known as heralds. With few exceptions, every one of Golarion's deities has its own herald, a favored minion that serves as a messenger and emissary throughout the planes and upon the mortal realm. While not necessarily the most powerful of a deity's minions, heralds embody fundamental elements of a god's faiths and philosophies, and thus prove particularly suited to interactions with mortal worshipers-although a herald appears only at the direct order of a deity, not merely because a powerful cleric requires aid. Thus, heralds are creatures myth, and their appearances mark lives and events of legend.</p><p>In the Pathfinder RPG, heralds are unique outsiders of approximately CR 15 with 18 or fewer Hit Dice, making them available for summons via the spell greater planar ally.

Occasionally, hanivers replace items they've stolen or leave their old treasures-seashells, old fish, clumps of sand-in containers or clothing they have rooted through. They do this without any added difficultly to their Sleight of Hand checks.","Haniver gremlins haunt the stories of sailors and fishing communities, featuring prominently in parables told to naughty children by disapproving parents. A thousand such tales exist, each a variation on a common theme- the gremlins flap up from the sea, startle nasty fishermen or disobedient youths, and make off with their trinkets. Yet as is rarely the case with such tales, nearly every word of these stories-no matter how unlikely or comic- proves near to the truth. Strange fey creatures that enjoy skimming whitecaps, flipping horseshoe crabs, and fatalistically teasing dolphins and sharks, hanivers endlessly indulge a mad racial curiosity. Such is their obsession that every haniver must know what is under every rock, in every basket, and beneath every hat. Should they like what they find, they typically attempt to make off with it, clinging to their prize like a beloved heirloom until the next curiosity or shiny treasure catches their attention. Hanivers have no concept of worth, though they know much of desirability, and might hang onto an item they would otherwise discard in moments if another creature-or former owner-expresses desire for it. The gremlins don't steal out of any sense of maliciousness, but merely out of curiosity and selfishness. The most intelligent occasionally even believe that they're trading, leaving behind old ""treasures""-often strange or natural items that barely fit the description-in place of things they've claimed. Regardless, folklore advises those who have something stolen by a haniver to simply abandon it rather than face the frustration of attempting to rescue it- hence the tendency of fishermen to blame the hanivers whenever something goes missing. Hanivers possess flat, leathery bodies with only a few thin bones. Most stand little more than a foot tall and 1-1/2 feet across, and weigh less than 5 pounds. Ecology Strange beings, even for fey, haniver gremlins bear similarities to both sprites and some breeds of coastal fish. Their fin-like wings grant them great mobility, both above and below the waves, aiding in their odd habit of flitting in and out of rolling waves. Sets of tiny gills and lungs alike allow them to survive in both environments, making them strangely oblivious to the quandaries of those that cannot. If forced to the ground, a haniver moving along land is a pitiful sight, as it scrabbles its way across the earth with its feeble claws and flops like a fish at the bottom of a boat. Habitat & Society Hanivers rarely travel far from the ocean, preferring the coast both for the comfort of salt water and for the strange things they often find washed up on beaches.Even though they don't require water to live, their leathery bodies dry out over time, becoming chafed and stiff. Thus, few hanivers spend more than an hour out of the water. These gremlins rarely keep lairs or places they call theirs, though most favor small flat underwater crevices or gaps in sea cliffs on those rare occasions when they feel like sleeping. Some hanivers keep small troves for their treasures, and such nooks might be numerous and any place a gremlin deems safe. Often seeming oblivious to others of their kind, or even avoiding them-fleeing from those who might also take a fancy to objects that fascinate them-hanivers occasionally travel together in small mobs. Banding together for safety as they flit across and below coastal waves, these gremlins can prove incredibly frustrating, even dangerous, should they notice something of interest en masse. Ships at sea, lone fishermen, and even whales and some other forms of large marine life go out of their way to avoid swarms of hanivers. Those that don't risk finding themselves captured amid a storm of inexplicably terrifying, flapping pests, their every possession pilfered by the quick-fingered gremlins. Treasure With no real care for the treasures they collect or interest in items of value, hanivers swipe things based wholly on whether an object strikes their curiosity. Certain objects are guaranteed haniver bait, most specifically any object with a lid or flap or anything that shines. As such, chests, packs, boxes, and tents prove irresistible to these gremlins, as do metal arms and armor, coins, gems, lanterns, fishing lures, buttons, sea shells, and the like-the shinier, the better. Additionally, every haniver has its own favorite treasures, and while one might need to claim every new feather it sees, another might obsess over objects that look like they'd make an entertaining noise when dropped from a height. Such fascinations are never malicious, but occasionally lead hanivers to imperil delicate objects or small creatures. On the other hand, hanivers' fixations can sometime prove their undoing, as these thieves' curiosity about closed spaces make these unsuspecting gremlins notoriously easy to capture, and other curiosities might directly lead to messy ends as they attempt to steal from animals, working machinery, or-most commonly-angry humanoids. Hanivers occasionally collect items that prove durable and particularly pleasing. Such treasures they place in outof- the-way hidey-holes, such as underwater crevices, high tree hollows, and gaps underneath loose shingles. While such collections usually prove worthless, containing only bits of glass, pieces of paper, bent nails, or children's toys, some fishermen tell of the fortunate costermonger whose chimney rained gold-the result of a coin-collecting haniver's poor choice in hiding spots. As Hanivers are widely reviled by sailors and any who dwell along the coast, many town constabularies or old timers hold to an age-old tradition of paying a copper for the body of a haniver. Legends say that the gremlins fear the bodies of their own kind and will avoid any house that nails a dead haniver above its door, or the fisherman who carries a haniver corpse amid his tackle. The only problem is that, unless properly prepared and dried (requiring a DC 11 Craft [leather] or Profession [fisherman] check), haniver flesh begins to reek terribly about an hour after death, much like the smell of weekold fish. To approximate such gruesome talismans, children in many coastal communities enjoy ΓÇ£candied gremlinsΓÇ¥-haniver-shaped dried fish or ray covered in salt and sticky sugar.","<link rel=""stylesheet""href=""PF.css""><div><h2>Gremlin, Haniver</h2><h3><i>Gremlin, Haniver This small, bizarre humanoid creature has strange yellow skin and tiny black eyes that burn with malevolence.

When a harpy sings, all creatures aside from other harpies within a 300-foot spread must succeed on a DC 16 Will saving throw or become captivated. A creature that successfully saves is not subject to the same harpy's song for 24 hours. A victim under the effects of the captivating song moves toward the harpy using the most direct means available. If the path leads them into a dangerous area such as through fire or off a cliff, that creature receives a second saving throw to end the effect before moving into peril.  Captivated creatures can take no actions other than to defend themselves. A victim within 5 feet of the harpy simply stands and offers no resistance to the harpy's attacks. This effect continues for as long as the harpy sings and for 1 round thereafter. This is a sonic mind-affecting charm effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.","Often viewed as vicious and corrupted creatures, harpies know how creatures think and act. This understanding gives them an advantage when it comes to finding their favorite meals. While creatures of the wild easily fall victim to their captivating songs, these vile bird-women prefer their meals spiced with complex sentient thoughts.  Easy prey makes for a boring meal.  While ultimately savage and without remorse for their actions, a number of harpies live close to humanoid societies and enjoy parlaying with creatures that they see as potential meals.  Harpies tend to wear baubles and trinkets stolen from their victims, as they like to indulge in the shiny ornaments of mankind. Up close, these creatures reek with the stench of consumed victims, and they rarely let creatures not yet captivated too near, lest they smell the gore and decay upon their feathers.

A creature that successfully saves is not subject to the same harpy's song for 24 hours. A victim under the effects of the captivating song moves toward the harpy using the most direct means available.

Captivated creatures can take no actions other than to defend themselves. A victim within 5 feet of the harpy simply stands and offers no resistance to the harpy's attacks.

Called ""phyriphlegeians"" by titans and some of the other elder races of the multiverse, these arrogant and most ancient of giants care only for their own tyrannies, petty schemes made abominable by their masters' scale, strength, and disregard for the survival of all other beings. More than capable of personally ruining most of their own foes physically, Hell gigas prefer campaigns of fear and pain, expending legions of slaves before bringing their own monstrous might to bear upon thoroughly defeated foes-though their rage often provokes them to forgo more satisfying climaxes in favor of immediate destruction. The typical Hell gigas stands well over 50 feet tall and weighs upward of 20 tons, in addition to the weight of its armor of bone and metal. Ecology Exceptionally rare creatures, even on their native plane and compared to others of the waning gigas races, Hell gigas bear the crushing weight of beings that have endured millennia of life in Hell. Most appear as wasted giants bearing the scars of countless skirmishes and hardships, many armored over in half-living suits of exposed muscle, knotty bone, and grisly iron. Even with such second skins, the gigas radiate auras of infernal heat, which, along with their incredible strength, allow them to sculpt stone and iron into grim structures and vicious weapons. Habitat & Society Most Hell gigas live on the infernal layers of Avernus, Dis (beyond the city), and Phlegethon, keeping to the mountains and masterless expanses beyond the interests of devils and the damned. In some such realms lie the rare, crumbled ruins of fortresses even larger than the gigas' power to craft. Within these ruins and the lavasoaked catacombs below, the Hell gigas make their homes, living as despots apart from others of their kind, ruling over stray fiends, hellspawn, and wayward souls. Few Hell gigas care to venture forth from the infernal realm, finding other planes uncomfortably cold. When they do, they universally hold a special hatred for fire giants, loathing the giants yet at the same time delighting in enslaving them and forcing them to do their will. Hell gigas attempt to avoid devils as much as possible. While a gigas can easily crush most devils, those who slight greater devils or members of the diabolical nobility risk destruction or enslavement by the easily offended lords of Hell. The First Giants Scholars of the unfathomable eons that mark the immortal tides of extraplanar history have long debated by what means the inhabitants of the Material Plane took their varied-yet in many ways similar-forms. Many adhere to the assumption that creator deities designed each mortal race, creating what they deemed as right or desirable in miniature multitudes. Others, however, claim it began with the titans. Mighty beings, not unlike gods themselves in many ways, titans possess power beyond most races and a history stretching back before even the oldest mortal races. Although the titan race has diminished, now inhabiting only the most remote corners of Elysium and the Thanatotic realms of the Abyss, their forms have persisted throughout the millennia, and their ancient progeny and myriad inheritors now range where titans once ruled. After ages of life upon the disparate planes of existence, the true titans gave rise to scions imbued with the powers of those strange realms, beings known as gigas, which were less than their progenitors but still mighty beyond reason. Distinctive to each realm the titans trod, the gigas rose as servants and emissaries of their lords and ancestors, carving out dominions among the natives of the planes that so shaped them. As countless ages passed and gates opened, allowing passage to the Material Plane, both titans and gigas found their way to new realms. While most titans cared little for these small, mundane worlds, the gigas found places where they could, for the first time, be masters in their own right. And as the gigas were born of both titankind and the planes, so were the gigas' spawn, the giants. Within the lands the gigas settled arose new beings, whole races specially adapted to life within their specific environs. With the march of countless epochs the titans waned, and so did their children, and their children's children. Today, titans remain rare, little-known even among the planes, declining as they suffer from the wounds of an ages-old conflict. The gigas, too, stand distant, removing to the frontiers of realms they once mastered-Hell gigas picking across the ruins of mountain fastnesses, Maelstrom gigas coasting ether storms upon islands of reality, Nirvana gigas crafting and dominating new dominions of dreams, and countless more withdrawing in the face of extinction. Even on the mortal plane, the age of giants has passed on most worlds, with the great beings of ancient times retreating in the face of countless lesser races, devoid of the giants' might yet powerful in numbers. Some draw a connection between humans (as well as some other races) and giants suggestive of a heritage similar to that of giants, gigas, and the titans before them, yet from the limited vantage of mortal lives, few definite corollaries can be made. Perhaps in future eons the truth of such conjecture might make itself apparent to the inheritors of humankind.","<link rel=""stylesheet""href=""PF.css""><div><h2>GIGAS, HELL </h2><h3><i>A giant like a mountain of corpses thunders into view.

This extraordinary bulk provides them with a +10 bonus on their combat maneuver defense. Blasphemous Bile (Su) 30-ft. line, once every 1d4 hours; damage 4d6 acid, Reflex DC 23 half. Those struck by this bile find themselves drenched in liquid corruption so profound it impedes the power of non-evil divine magic for 10 minutes. Any non-evil divine spellcaster who casts a spell targeting a creature soaked in an ayngavhaul's bile must make a DC 23 caster level check or have the spell fail. A creature affected by this bile may wash off the sludge by spending a round and using at least a gallon of fluid to cleanse itself. The save DC is Constitution-based. Devil Summoner (Su) Ayngavhauls know the secrets of all breeds of devils, utilizing such leverage in the summoning of their kind. Any devil within 30 feet of an ayngavhaul has half again the normal chance of having a fiend respond to its summon devil ability. For example, an osyluth's usual 35% chance to summon another bone devil increases to 52% when within 30 feet of an ayngavhaul. Summoning bonuses provided by multiple ayngavahuls do not stack. Ayngavahuls are immune to this ability, from both themselves and others of their kind. Searing Word (Su) An ayngavhaul can speak words of torment, giving them shape and sending them streaking toward their enemies in the form of diabolical sigils. Any good-aligned creature struck by one of these infernal words takes 3d6 points of hellfire damage (half fire, half evil energy); nongood creatures take half damage. These words cannot affect creatures affected by protection from evil or within an area of magical silence. Summon Devil (Sp) Once per day an ayngavhaul can attempt to summon 2d6 imps, 1d4 bearded devils, or 2 bone devils with an 80% chance of success, or a contract devil (see Pathfinder Adventure Path volume #12) with a 45% chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of a 6th-level spell. Throne of Skulls (Su) All ayngavhauls hover upon fearsome infernal thrones. These thrones grant the devils their fly speed and a +4 armor bonus. Should an ayngavhaul be grappled or knocked down, it is unseated from its throne and loses these benefits. An ayngavhaul has telepathic command over its throne and may call its conveyance back and reseat itself as a full-round action.","Bloated scholars of despair, ayngavhauls collect, create, and spread heresies and apocrypha, sowing disbelief and corruption to all who would seek their foul wisdom. Ironically among the most humanlike, yet still most repulsive breeds of devilkind, these corpulent blasphemers are barely even able to move without the aid of their profane floating thrones. Although their bloated forms make them considerably less of a threat than their brethren physically, they speak maledictions foul enough to agonize those who hear them, yet even with such powers of vicious wisdom, their true strength lies in their envenomed words and temptations of the mind. Their centuries of research grant them great leverage over their diabolical kin, and few devils dare not obey the summons of these hellish scholars. Ayngavhauls are roughly ovular in form, their def lated girths about 10 feet tall with their rolls of wet gristle spreading over 13 feet wide. Off their thrones, these devils weigh approximately 2,300 pounds, though the eldest can weigh considerably more. Ecology Ayngavhauls' bloated girths make them slaves to their repulsive physical forms. All ayngavhauls, even the newly formed, are monstrously obese, trapped within prisons of their own leaking, diabolical flesh. To aid them, though, the forges of Phlegethon create terrifying thrones empowered by infernal magics. These foul chariots hold their corpulent masters aloft, serving as both vehicles and sources of profane protection. Each throne of skulls is bound to a specific ayngavhaul, dissolving into a pile of ashes and a breath of searing iron dust should its master be destroyed. Habitat & Society The majority of ayngavhuals frequent the grim libraries of Hell, particularly the mired museums of Stygia; the Fallen Fastness of Dis; and Betzebbul, the palace of Baalzebul, in Cocytus. Within these heretical storehouses and academies of evil, these grotesque devils rewrite the histories of countless worlds to obscure truths and skew the past toward the desires of Hell. Grotesque curators of a sort, individual ayngavhauls take great pride in specializing in fields none of their brethren have ever thought to focus their studies upon-the more obscure and blasphemous, the better. Thus, while one devil might spend eons learning all there is to know of linnorm frost poisons, another might research the nuances of Azlanti voice tearing. Each seeks to promote its particular field of research above all others, sowing its knowledge among their blasphemous works, minions, and summoners who might put such foul wisdom to the most sinister uses. They prove incessantly paranoid that the works of their brethren might be outstripping their own discoveries, or that others in related fields might be stealing their research, thus proving both suspicious of their kindred and intimately familiar with the works of other infernal scholars. As such, a single ayngavhaul might begrudgingly point a summoner in search of specific information toward a diabolical expert, though these knowledge-obsessed fiends never reveal their secrets without demanding a price.","<link rel=""stylesheet""href=""PF.css""><div><h2>Devil, Heresy</h2><h3><i>Seemingly fused with a monstrous throne of iron skulls, this impossibly corpulent being floats several feet off the ground.

Toss (Ex) A male hodag charging 20 feet or more that damages a foe with its gore attack can throw its foe with a special combat maneuver check. The opponent must be corporeal and at least one size category smaller than the hodag. If the hodag's maneuver succeeds, its opponent is thrown back 10 feet (in a direction chosen by the hodag) and falls prone. The hodag can only toss its opponent in a straight line. If an obstacle prevents the creature's movement, both the creature tossed and the object struck take 1d6 points of damage, and the creature falls prone in the space adjacent to the obstacle. A hodag can also toss an opponent straight up into the air. This does not move the opponent but causes it to take an additional 1d6 points of damage from falling. Trackless (Ex) A hodag sweeps its tail behind itself in a way that obscures its tracks. Attempts to track a hodag have their normal DC increased by 10.","As stout as a bull, with a reptile's scaly, spiked body, hodags are fierce forest predators hunting along the edges of civilization in the thick woods. Green, gray, and black scales cover the beasts, helping them to blend in amid the underbrush, and sharp spikes stand along their backs and run down their powerful, dangerous tails. Loggers share stories of being followed by hodags and seeing their glowing red eyes in the oppressive darkness of the thick forest. In the wintertime, when snow and ice blankets the region, hodags grow a foul-smelling coat of greasy, dark brown fur, sprouting in tufts from between their scales and helping them blend in with dead vegetation. Males sport large curving spikes on their heads that look like forward-facing horns. Many believe that hodags are not true-breeding beasts but rather a unique and specific terror that has lived and hunted certain woodlands for ages. Many regional people living near such wildernesses consider hodags a myth, nothing more than the sort of tall tale that is typical of excitable rural folk. Some go so far to use ""hodagger"" as a derogatory term for the more rustic and simple people working the forests and rivers. Folklorists say the first hodag rose from the charred remains of an ox sacrificed to cleanse foul spirits. The ritual failed on the seventh day of burning, and this foul beast climbed from the pyre and devoured those performing the rites as a putrid smell spread through the forest like a rancid fog. Superstitious lumberjacks refuse to work when similar fogs hang thick in the woods, even though many who don't know or don't care about such tales claim such fogs are perfectly natural or mere swamp gases. The oral tradition passed down from the people living in regions hunted by hodags tells that the name comes from the combination of ""horse"" and ""dog,"" two of the beast's favorite meals. A typical male hodag measures over 10 feet from the snout to the tip of the tail and 4-1/2 feet at the shoulder, though when they rear back on two legs, they reach far more intimidating heights. Females tend to be a foot or more smaller but are stockier; both male and female hodags weigh around 700 pounds. Female hodags also lack horns (female hodags have no gore or toss attack and are CR 4). Ecology Hodags do not typically seek out creatures to hunt. Rather, the unpredictable beasts wander the forest and countryside in the hope of something crossing their paths. If a hodag becomes interested-something that seems to depend wholly on the appeal of a being's scent or appearance-it will follow and stalk a creature, unwilling to stop until it has fed upon its prey. Hodags sometimes stalk their prey for weeks, some say to fill victims with fear and panic, making them thinner. They tend to prefer lean meals that provide considerable crunching sounds as they are consumed. Some tales claim the beast doesn't feed upon the actual bodies of its victims but rather on the fear of those about to be consumed and the pleasure of the crunch. The scene of a hodag attack appears to back up this claim, as the beast dismembers and shreds its victims, throwing viscera and body parts about the area and consuming very little actual meat. This is actually due to the eating habits of the creature. While they enjoy killing at any time, hodags gorge themselves only once every 3 months. During these feasts, they can eat an entire herd of horses, consuming thousands of pounds of food in one attack. Habitat and Society Extremely secluded and territorial creatures, hodags are rarely seen together. During mating season, hodags expand their usual hunting grounds and wander farther from their dens on the chance that they may find a mate. The courtship is abrupt and to the point, and after the act of breeding, the two hodags depart in opposite directions. The female hodag finds an isolated place in the forest and digs a den in which to birth her young. Despite their reptilian appearance, hodags do not lay eggs but rather give live birth to a small litter of no more than three or four young. Sibling rivalry is strong and play is often rough. Not all young hodags survive this competition, ensuring only the strongest of the litter make it to maturity. Hodags on Golarion Tales of hodags and hodag-like creatures fill the legends of several regions and backwaters across Avistan. Noted here are three locations where the myth of the hodag takes on a fearsome life. Falcon's Hollow: The thick woods surrounding Falcon's Hollow in Andoran echo with cautionary tales offered to children and apprentice lumberjacks of a particularly massive hodag missing an eye. Everyone knows someone who claims her great-great-granddad was responsible for plucking out the eye of this frightening beast or was a companion of the one responsible. There are as many stories about how it happened as there are surnames of those said to be responsible. The Chitterwood: In southern Isger, a foul hodag hunts without end. Oral tradition from the region places this dark beast there long before man settled, and storytellers claim the creature is actually a living shadow in the terrifying form of a hodag. The only safety from the beast lies in sunlight, something not always in great supply deep in the heart of the wood. The Lower Sellen: In the southern part of the River Kingdoms, where the Sellen River collects its tributaries into a mighty torrent flowing toward the lands downstream, tales of a hodag capable of flight keep travelers watching the skies as they move through the region. Stories dispute the origin of this terrible beast, with some claiming the creature resulted from a mad druid's magic and others saying its mother was a powerful manticore. The mysterious claw marks high in several of the region's trees are cited as evidence of the beast's fearsome climbing ability.","<link rel=""stylesheet""href=""PF.css""><div><h2>Hodag</h2><h3><i><i>Spikes cover the body of this vaguely reptilian creature</i>, <i>jutting forth from nearly every angle.

They are weak combatants but make effective spies, messengers, and scouts. A homunculus's creator determines its precise features; some are more refined looking, but most creators don't bother to improve the creature's appearance beyond the minimum necessary for functioning. Homunculi are little more than tools designed to carry out assigned tasks. They are extensions of their creators, sharing the same alignment and basic nature. A homunculus never willingly travels more than a mile from its master, though it can be removed forcibly. If this occurs, the creature does everything in its power to return to this range, as it cannot communicate with its master beyond this distance. An attack that destroys a homunculus deals 2d10 points of damage to its master. If the creature's master is slain, the homunculus goes insane-it loses its Intelligence score, all feats, and all skill ranks, and generally claims the immediate surroundings as its domain, mindlessly attacking any who intrude upon its lair. On rare occasions, a homunculus freed from its servitude rises above its master's original intent and becomes more than a half-insane construct guardian of a long-forgotten lair. In some cases, a homunculus might even come to see itself as the rightful heir to its master's legacy, or even the reincarnated spirit of the master himself. Construction A homunculus is shaped from a mixture of clay, ash, mandrake root, spring water, and one pint of the creator's own blood. These materials cost 50 gp. After the body is sculpted, it is animated through an extended magical ritual that requires a specially prepared laboratory or workroom, similar to an alchemist's laboratory, and costing an additional 1,000 gp to supply. If the creator is personally constructing the creature's body, the building and ritual can be performed together. A homunculus with more than 2 Hit Dice can be created, but each additional Hit Die adds +2,000 gp to the cost to create. The person whose blood is used to form a homunculus's body becomes its master; it is possible for one person to give blood for the creation, another to sculpt the base material, and another to magically animate it as a minion for the one who provided the blood.

They are extensions of their creators, sharing the same alignment and basic nature.</p><p>A homunculus never willingly travels more than a mile from its master, though it can be removed forcibly. If this occurs, the creature does everything in its power to return to this range, as it cannot communicate with its master beyond this distance. An attack that destroys a homunculus deals 2d10 points of damage to its master. If the creature's master is slain, the homunculus goes insane-it loses its Intelligence score, all feats, and all skill ranks, and generally claims the immediate surroundings as its domain, mindlessly attacking any who intrude upon its lair.</p><p>On rare occasions, a homunculus freed from its servitude rises above its master's original intent and becomes more than a half-insane construct guardian of a long-forgotten lair. In some cases, a homunculus might even come to see itself as the rightful heir to its master's legacy, or even the reincarnated spirit of the master himself.</p><p><b>Construction</b><br> A homunculus is shaped from a mixture of clay, ash, mandrake root, spring water, and one pint of the creator's own blood. These materials cost 50 gp. After the body is sculpted, it is animated through an extended magical ritual that requires a specially prepared laboratory or workroom, similar to an alchemist's laboratory, and costing an additional 1,000 gp to supply. If the creator is personally constructing the creature's body, the building and ritual can be performed together. A homunculus with more than 2 Hit Dice can be created, but each additional Hit Die adds +2,000 gp to the cost to create.</p><p>The person whose blood is used to form a homunculus's body becomes its master; it is possible for one person to give blood for the creation, another to sculpt the base material, and another to magically animate it as a minion for the one who provided the blood.</p><p><b>Homunculus</b><br> <b>CL</b> 7th; <b>Price</b> 2,050 gp<br> <b>Construction</b><br> <b>Requirements</b> Craft Construct, arcane eye, mirror image, mending; Skill Craft (leather) or Craft (sculptures) DC 12; <b>Cost</b> 1,050 gp.</p></h4></div>",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,,NULL,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,NULL,NULL,NULL

This fast healing applies only to damage inflicted on the hydra's body. Hydra Traits (Ex) A hydra can be killed by severing all of its heads or slaying its body. Any attack that is not an attempt to sever a head affects the body, including area attacks or attacks that cause piercing or bludgeoning damage. To sever a head, an opponent must make a sunder attempt with a slashing weapon targeting a head. A head is considered a separate weapon with hardness 0 and hit points equal to the hydra's HD. To sever a head, an opponent must inflict enough damage to reduce the head's hit points to 0 or less. Severing a head deals damage to the hydra's body equal to the hydra's current HD. A hydra can't attack with a severed head, but takes no other penalties. Regenerate Head (Ex) When a hydra's head is destroyed, two heads regrow in 1d4 rounds. A hydra cannot have more than twice its original number of heads at any one time. To prevent new heads from growing, at least 5 points of acid or fire damage must be dealt to the stump (a touch attack to hit) before they appear. Acid or fire damage from area attacks can affect stumps and the body simultaneously. A hydra doesn't die from losing its heads until all are cut off and the stumps seared by acid or fire.","You can make more powerful hydras by increasing their Hit Dice-each added HD increases the hydra's statistics as appropriate, but also gives it one additional head and a +1 increase to its natural armor. A hydra's CR increases by +1 for each Hit Die it gains. Cryohydra/Pyrohydra (+2 CR): Variants of the standard hydra, the cryohydra lives in cold marshes or on glaciers, while the pyrohydra prefers deserts or volcanic mountains. A cryohydra gains the Cold subtype, while a pyrohydra gains the Fire subtype. Each of its heads has a breath weapon (15- ft. cone, 3d6 cold damage [cryohydra] or 3d6 fire damage [pyrohydra], Ref lex half ) useable every 1d4 rounds.

Any attack that is not an attempt to sever a head affects the body, including area attacks or attacks that cause piercing or bludgeoning damage. To sever a head, an opponent must make a sunder attempt with a slashing weapon targeting a head. A head is considered a separate weapon with hardness 0 and hit points equal to the hydra's HD. To sever a head, an opponent must inflict enough damage to reduce the head's hit points to 0 or less. Severing a head deals damage to the hydra's body equal to the hydra's current HD. A hydra can't attack with a severed head, but takes no other penalties.</h5><h5><b> Regenerate Head (Ex)</b> When a hydra's head is destroyed, two heads regrow in 1d4 rounds. A hydra cannot have more than twice its original number of heads at any one time. To prevent new heads from growing, at least 5 points of acid or fire damage must be dealt to the stump (a touch attack to hit) before they appear. Acid or fire damage from area attacks can affect stumps and the body simultaneously.

A janni is human-sized, standing about 6 feet tall and weighing about 180 pounds. Jann are physically strong and courageous, and do not take kindly to insult or injury. Most are quite prone to seeing insult even when none is intended by the speaker. If overwhelmed in battle, they escape using flight and invisibility, returning later with reinforcements. Jann enjoy their privacy, preferring the solitude of the deep desert and isolated oases. They are usually suspicious of humans, but are often willing to give them the benefit of the doubt. Jann have a strong cultural tradition of hospitality, and will never turn away someone in need of food, water, or shelter, though they might expect payment in the form of a favor at some later date. Among the other genie races, jann generally have good relations with both djinn and shaitans. While not actively enemies, jann dislike the proud and aloof marids. Jann have a distinct aversion to the efreet, who often try to enslave them or conscript them into their armies. A small percentage of jann are noble. Noble jann, often called sheikhs or amirs, have 9 Hit Dice, Strength 19, and Intelligence 18, and gain the following spell-like abilities: 3/day-augury, detect magic, and divination.

A janni is human-sized, standing about 6 feet tall and weighing about 180 pounds.</p><p>Jann are physically strong and courageous, and do not take kindly to insult or injury. Most are quite prone to seeing insult even when none is intended by the speaker. If overwhelmed in battle, they escape using flight and invisibility, returning later with reinforcements.</p><p>Jann enjoy their privacy, preferring the solitude of the deep desert and isolated oases. They are usually suspicious of humans, but are often willing to give them the benefit of the doubt. Jann have a strong cultural tradition of hospitality, and will never turn away someone in need of food, water, or shelter, though they might expect payment in the form of a favor at some later date.</p><p>Among the other genie races, jann generally have good relations with both djinn and shaitans. While not actively enemies, jann dislike the proud and aloof marids. Jann have a distinct aversion to the efreet, who often try to enslave them or conscript them into their armies.</p><p>A small percentage of jann are noble. Noble jann, often called sheikhs or amirs, have 9 Hit Dice, Strength 19, and Intelligence 18, and gain the following spell-like abilities: 3/day-augury, detect magic, and divination.

The object and lar merge, taking on the statistics of an animated object of the same size (see animated objects in the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary). A lar may possess any object of Tiny to Large size. If the animated object is destroyed or targeted by dispel good, the lar is expelled and takes 1d6 points of damage per size category of the possessed object-1d6 for a Tiny object, 2d6 for a Small object, and so on. The lar is then free to possess another object, if one is available. If a lar is reduced to 0 hit points or fewer, it is banished to its statua for 24 hours, after which it is fully healed. If the lar does not have a statua, or the statua is destroyed while it is at 0 or fewer hit points, the lar is killed. Natural Invisibility (Su) This ability is constant, allowing a lar to remain invisible even when attacking. This ability is inherent and not subject to the invisibility purge spell. Statua (Su) All lares rely on a small stone figure, known as a statua, for survival. This figurine serves as a lar's home, resting place, and tie to the Material Plane. Lares typically rest within their statua, finding it a comfortable place from which to oversee their surroundings. For every round a lar spends doing nothing besides resting within its statua, it regenerates 1 point of damage. However, being separated from the statua for extended periods of time weakens the lar. For every 5 hours a lar remains outside of its statua, it takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage. Only returning to the statua can heal this damage. If a lar falls to 0 hit points, even from nonlethal damage, it is banished back to the Upper Planes. While a lar's statua exists, the connected lar is treated as a native outsider. Any attempt to banish the lar-through dismissal or a similar spell-merely transports the creature back to its statua. If the statua is destroyed, a lar can be dismissed from the Material Plane as normal. Suggestion (Sp) A lar can influence creatures as per the spell suggestion, with some variations, at will. First, to influence a creature in this manner, a lar must occupy the same square as its target. The lar is considered to be able to speak any language and communicate with any creature-even animals and vermin (which are usually immune to mind-affecting effects)-for the purposes of this effect. The target may attempt to resist a lar's suggestion by making a DC 17 Will save. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.","Sometimes referred to as ""watchsouls,"" lares are subtle, benevolent spirits that prefer to spend their existence on the Material Plane minding the homes and fortunes of deserving mortals. Kind but aloof, lares watch over their mortal wards and help only when they are most needed. Yet where their homes are intruded upon or their charges imperiled, they prove frighteningly effective guardians, turning everything in their tiny dominions into living weapons. Lares are innately invisible, making the nature of their existence something of a mystery. Originating from the Upper Planes, these spirits have no true bodies and appear only as vague spectral eddies to those capable of seeing invisible beings. Yet while their forms prove vague, their blessings are undeniable. Ecology Although formed upon the Upper Planes, lares find themselves drawn to the Material Plane. While some seek out mortal souls to watch over out of some innate sense of protectiveness, others feel a more specific draw, searching out members of specific races, nations, heritages, or families. Upon taking up residence in a home of their choosing, what motivates and sustains these benevolent spirits is little understood. They seem to take sustenance from positive emotions, growing weak if left in places with quarrelsome residents or that fall to ruin. Lares never seem to die from negative emotions or abandonment, though, merely biding their time in the hopes that their dwelling might someday again host amenable residents. Habitat & Society Mortals sharing their home with a lar often create household shrines to them. These tiny sanctuaries, called lararia (singular lararium), serve to house the lar's statuae. Though the lar does not require offerings, many families give them anyway, treating their spirit with reverence. Over time, the lar might become like a member of the family, with the spirit offering advice and taking a keen interest in the raising of children and protection of the home. Once a family has been chosen, a lar does not leave its dwelling, not even to follow the family during extended leaves. The only exception to this is if the family takes the statua with them, though this is not a practice lares encourage. Since the statuae are their anchors to the Material Plane, lares are insecure about exposing them to the outside world where they might be lost, stolen, or damaged. Summoning a Lar A tradtion said to have been created and passed down since the days of lost Azlant, many families, homes, and even shops and public buildings along the Inner Sea invite lares to take up residence, seeking the blessings of the divine. Few, however, know when their invitations have been accepted, though, as a lar might prove aloof for months or years as it gauges its new wards. In order to welcome such spirits, families construct tiny effigies called statuae in the shapes of honored ancestors, regional heroes, or fanciful creatures, in which the spirits might come and reside. These statuae are non-magical effigies, typically composed of stone or fine wood and anointed with fine lacquers and oils, requiring 2 days, a successful DC 20 Craft check, and 40 gp to create. Once created, these Diminuative figures typically have a hardness of 5 and 10 hit points. If destroyed, a statua may be recreated in this same method. Summoning a lar is a more elaborate affair, requiring nightly prayers and small offerings of fruit, incense, flowers, and similar gifts to the statuae. For each night one prays to the figure for their home or family's protection there is a cumulative 1% chance a lar hears and turns its attention to the petitioner. This attention doesn't mean that a lar will aid a home, but merely that it has heard the prayer, and it might yet decide that its philosophies and virtues are incompatible with the supplicant. If such is the case, the lar quietly ignores the prayer, and the petitioner's chance to gain a lar's attention resets to 0%, all entirely unknown to the mortal. When a lar does accept an invitation, it may immediately plane shift to the associated statua, claiming it as its own. A lar typically makes some subtle acknowledgement that it has come, perhaps slightly altering its statua's appearance or lighting candles upon its arrival. It still often takes months, even years, for a lar to become intimate with a family and make its presence actively known, and some never do. Lares in Golarion Lares exhibit extremely variable personalities, and while some prove aloof even after centuries, others become gregarious members of their protected families. Noted here are just two such dichotomous lares rumored to guard sites in Golarion. Uncle Penates: When only the members of the Aphinius family of Taldor are present, their home's lar possesses the expensive painting within their drawing room. From its hidden statua just behind the painting, the boisterous spirit delights in animating the fine oils to make it appear as though the paunchy and opulently dressed Taldan nobleman pictured is personally relaxing and conversing with the family members nearby. None of the family know the nature of the effect, many believing the house is haunted by the spirit of their ancestor, but none fear or begrudge the presence of kind old Uncle Penates. Wolz: This lar has long lingered in the burnt-out ruin of an old stone cottage just east of Windsong Abby in Varisia. His wolfshaped statua having fallen beneath a pile of hearth stones, Wolz subtly watches over any goodly travelers who come to rest in the tiny ruin, lighting a fire, providing water, and warding off danger as if they were his long-lost family.","<link rel=""stylesheet""href=""PF.css""><div><h2>Lar</h2><h3><i>A stirring in the air and rustle through the room reveals a presence-a subtle aura both cautious and curious.</i></h3><br></br></div><div class=""heading""><p class=""alignleft"">Lar</p><p class=""alignright"">CR 5</p><div style=""clear: both;""></div></div><div><h5><b>XP </b>1,600</h5><h5>LG  Medium outsider (good, incorporeal, lawful, native)</h5><h5><b>Init </b>+3; <b>Senses </b>darkvision 60 ft., low-light vision; Perception +13</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>DEFENSE</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>AC </b>17, touch 17, flat-footed 14 (+2 deflection, +3 Dex, +2 size)</h5><h5><b>hp </b>39 (6d10+6)</h5><h5><b>Fort </b>+3, <b>Ref </b>+7, <b>Will </b>+4</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>OFFENSE</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Spd </b>0 ft., fly 30 ft.

A pale blue light shines from where its eyes should be.,,PFRPG Bestiary,1,,"Few creatures are more feared than the lich. The pinnacle of necromantic art, the lich is a spellcaster who has chosen to shed his life as a method to cheat death by becoming undead. While many who reach such heights of power stop at nothing to achieve immortality, the idea of becoming a lich is abhorrent to most creatures. The process involves the extraction of the spellcaster's life-force and its imprisonment in a specially prepared phylactery-the spellcaster gives up life, but in trapping life he also traps his death, and as long as his phylactery remains intact he can continue on in his research and work without fear of the passage of time. The quest to become a lich is a lengthy one. While construction of the magical phylactery to contain the spellcaster's soul is a critical component, a prospective lich must also learn the secrets of transferring his soul into the receptacle and of preparing his body for the transformation into undeath, neither of which are simple tasks. Further complicating the ritual is the fact that no two bodies or souls are exactly alike-a ritual that works for one spellcaster might simply kill another or drive him insane. The exact methods for each spellcaster's transformation are left to the GM's discretion, but should involve expenditures of hundreds of thousands of gold pieces, numerous deadly adventures, and a large number of difficult skill checks over the course of months, years, or decades. The Lich's Phylactery An integral part of becoming a lich is the creation of the phylactery in which the character stores his soul. The only way to get rid of a lich for sure is to destroy its phylactery. Unless its phylactery is located and destroyed, a lich can rejuvenate after it is killed (see Creating a Lich, below). Each lich must create its own phylactery by using the Craft Wondrous Item feat. The character must be able to cast spells and have a caster level of 11th or higher. The phylactery costs 120,000 gp to create and has a caster level equal to that of its creator at the time of creation. The most common form of phylactery is a sealed metal box containing strips of parchment on which magical phrases have been transcribed. The box is Tiny and has 40 hit points, hardness 20, and a break DC of 40. Other forms of phylacteries can exist, such as rings, amulets, or similar items. Creating a Lich ""Lich"" is an acquired template that can be added to any living creature (referred to hereafter as the base creature), provided it can create the required phylactery. A lich retains all the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here. CR: Same as the base creature + 2. Alignment: Any evil. Type: The creature's type changes to undead. Do not recalculate BAB, saves, or skill ranks. Senses: A lich gains darkvision 60 ft. Armor Class: A lich has a +5 natural armor bonus or the base creature's natural armor bonus, whichever is better. Hit Dice: Change all of the creature's racial Hit Dice to d8s. All Hit Dice derived from class levels remain unchanged. As undead, liches use their Charisma modifiers to determine bonus hit points (instead of Constitution). Defensive Abilities: A lich gains channel resistance +4, DR 15/bludgeoning and magic, and immunity to cold and electricity (in addition to those granted by its undead traits). The lich also gains the following defensive ability. Rejuvenation (Su): When a lich is destroyed, its phylactery (which is generally hidden by the lich in a safe place far from where it chooses to dwell) immediately begins to rebuild the undead spellcaster's body nearby. This process takes 1d10 days-if the body is destroyed before that time passes, the phylactery merely starts the process anew. After this time passes, the lich wakens fully healed (albeit without any gear it left behind on its old body), usually with a burning need for revenge against those who previously destroyed it. Melee Attack: A lich has a touch attack that it can use once per round as a natural weapon. A lich fighting without weapons uses its natural weapons (if it has any) in addition to its touch attack (which is treated as a primary natural weapon that replaces one claw or slam attack, if the creature has any). A lich armed with a weapon uses its weapons normally, and can use its touch attack as a secondary natural weapon. Damage: A lich's touch attack uses negative energy to deal 1d8 points of damage to living creatures + 1 point of damage per 2 Hit Dice possessed by the lich. As negative energy, this damage can be used to heal undead creatures. A lich can take a full-round action to infuse itself with this energy, healing damage as if it had used its touch attack against itself. Special Attacks: A lich gains the two special attacks described below. Save DCs are equal to 10 + 1/2 lich's HD + lich's Cha modifier unless otherwise noted. Fear Aura (Su): Creatures of less than 5 HD in a 60- foot radius that look at the lich must succeed on a Will save or become frightened. Creatures with 5 HD or more must succeed at a Will save or be shaken for a number of rounds equal to the lich's Hit Dice. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same lich's aura for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. Paralyzing Touch (Su): Any living creature a lich hits with its touch attack must succeed on a Fortitude save or be permanently paralyzed. Remove paralysis or any spell that can remove a curse can free the victim (see the bestow curse spell description, with a DC equal to the lich's save DC). The effect cannot be dispelled. Anyone paralyzed by a lich seems dead, though a DC 20 Perception check or a DC 15 Heal check reveals that the victim is still alive. Abilities: Int +2, Wis +2, Cha +2. Being undead, a lich has no Constitution score. Skills: Liches have a +8 racial bonus on Perception, Sense Motive, and Stealth checks. A lich always treats Climb, Disguise, Fly, Intimidate, Knowledge (arcana), Knowledge (religion), Perception, Sense Motive, Spellcraft, and Stealth as class skills. Otherwise, skills are the same as the base creature.","<link rel=""stylesheet""href=""PF.css""><div><h2>Lich</h2><h3><i>Once fine robes hang in tatters from this withered corpse's frame.

Born in fury and profanity, Malbolgian cerberi rage forth, ferocious three-headed hell hounds the size of bulls and more than willing and capable of slaughtering their loathed Nessian warhound kindred. A typical cerberi stands a broad 4 feet tall and weighs over 200 pounds, while a Malbolgian cerberi can reach over 6 feet in height and weigh upward of 400 pounds. Ecology Denizens of Hell, cerberi embody the ferocity and covetousness of that realm. Bent to service as watch beasts or guardians at the gates of the Pit, cerberi possess unique abilities predisposing them to such grim service. Bearing some measure of mastery over souls and their fundamental ability to shift between planes, these infernal hounds easily trap their victims, preventing them from escaping to the safety of more favorable realms. This ability allows the beasts to prey upon both spirits and the denizens of the outer planes, which every so often attempt to leap between realms to avoid danger. Physically, cerberi appear akin to mortal canines, though in truth they hold little in common. As natives of Hell, they resemble devils more than the wolves and hounds of the Material Plane, their fleshless figures and three monstrous heads making this obvious at anything less than extreme distances. Despite the differences in physiology between mortal beasts and these keen hunters of souls, cerberi frequently find themselves treated like unthinking animals-largely due to their inability to speak. Such a mistake often proves deadly, as cerberi possess alert minds and genuine cunning. While most willingly accept the commands of more powerful masters and gory compensations for their efforts, cerberi are intelligent enough to know when they've been slighted and viciously turn on creatures who mistakenly think themselves their masters. Habitat & Society In their natural infernal environments, cerberi might be found anywhere powerful fiends have need for guardians. This makes them frequent fixtures among the dark vaults of Erebus, the estates of Dis, and the fortresses of Avernus. Capable trackers, especially adept at detecting the scent of wayward souls, cerberi also might be found among the legions of the first layer of Hell hunting the freshly arrived damned alongside other devils. Yet, beyond all other tasks, these three-headed hounds excel as captors and minders of the dead, assuring that none of Hell's charges escape their eternal fates. Cerberi's incredible ability to trap victims on planes and track the dead make them highly coveted servants across the multiverse. The live markets of Dis teem with cerberi for sale, both ravenous pups and tested hunters. Daemons and night hags especially covet cerberi and pay high prices for whole packs of the soul-hunting hounds. The hounds' bestial appearances and love of slaughter often cause those who consider themselves cerberi owners to forget the deviousness of their allies, a development that often ends poorly, if not bloodily, for the unwary and the weak. Outside of the devil-tamed reaches of Hell and other foul extraplanar wildernesses, small groups of cerberi gather in harsh, pack-like communities. Typically dominated by the strongest or wiliest member, such packs form swift and deadly tides, stalking trespassers upon their vast hunting grounds and doggedly pursuing any scent of lost souls. Although cerberi gain no sustenance from attacking the dead, as befits their infernal nature, all gain a vicious satisfaction at the feeling of an immortal essence discorporating forever within their deadly jaws.","<link rel=""stylesheet""href=""PF.css""><div><h2>Cerberi, Malbolgian </h2><h3><i>A beast leapt forth from the flames of Hell, this gigantic, threeheaded hound howls a sound like the cacophony of a raging wildfire.

Challenge Rating: Depends on Hit Dice, as follows: HD CR XP 1/2 1/6 65 1 1/3 135 2-3 1 400 4-5 2 600 6-7 3 800 8-9 4 1,200 10-11 5 1,600 12-14 6 2,400 15-17 7 3,200 18-20 8 4,800 Alignment: Always neutral evil. Type: The creature's type changes to undead. It retains any subtype except for alignment subtypes (such as good) and subtypes that indicate kind (such as giant). It does not gain the augmented subtype. It uses all the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here. Armor Class: Natural armor bonus changes as follows: Skeleton Size N atural Armor Bonus Tiny or smaller +0 Small +1 Medium or Large +2 Huge +3 Gargantuan +6 Colossal +10 Hit Dice: A skeleton drops any HD gained from class levels and changes racial HD to d8s. Creatures without racial HD are treated as if they have 1 racial HD. If the creature has more than 20 Hit Dice, it can't be made into a skeleton by the animate dead spell. A skeleton uses its Cha modifier (instead of its Con modifier) to determine bonus hit points. Saves: Base save bonuses are Fort +1/3 HD, Ref +1/3 HD, and Will +1/2 HD + 2. Defensive Abilities: A skeleton loses the base creature's defensive abilities and gains DR 5/bludgeoning and immunity to cold. It also gains all of the standard immunities and traits possessed by undead creatures. Speed: A winged skeleton can't use its wings to fly. If the base creature flew magically, so can the skeleton. All other movement types are retained. Attacks: A skeleton retains all the natural weapons, manufactured weapon attacks, and weapon proficiencies of the base creature, except for attacks that can't work without flesh. A creature with hands gains one claw attack per hand; the skeleton can strike with each of its claw attacks at its full attack bonus. A claw attack deals damage depending on the skeleton's size (see pages 301-302). If the base creature already had claw attacks with its hands, use the skeleton claw damage only if it's better. Special Attacks: A skeleton retains none of the base creature's special attacks. Abilities: A skeleton's Dexterity increases by +2. It has no Constitution or Intelligence score, and its Wisdom and Charisma scores change to 10. BAB: A skeleton's base attack bonus is equal to 3/4 of its Hit Dice. Skills: A skeleton loses all skill ranks possessed by the base creature and gains none of its own. Feats: A skeleton loses all feats possessed by the base creature and gains Improved Initiative as a bonus feat. Special Qualities: A skeleton loses most special qualities of the base creature. It retains any extraordinary special qualities that improve its melee or ranged attacks. Environment: Any, usually the same as base creature. Organization: Any. Treasure: Generally none, although sometimes a skeleton's creator arms it with magical armor or weapons. Variant Skeletons Numerous variant skeletons exist, such as those whose bones burn with an unending fire and those who drip with gore and reassemble themselves over time. Both of these variant skeletons can be created using animate dead, but they count as twice their normal number of Hit Dice per casting. Once controlled, they count normally against the controller's limit. Perhaps the most dangerous variant skeleton, though, is the skeletal champion. This skeleton retains its intellect, and often any class levels it possessed in life. A skeletal champion cannot be created with animate dead-these potent undead only arise under rare conditions similar to those that cause the manifestation of ghosts or via rare and highly evil rituals. Each of the following skeleton types modifies the base skeleton in a few key ways. Except as noted, these variations can be stacked with one another-it's possible to have a bloody burning skeletal champion. Bloody Skeleton A bloody skeleton is coated in a slick layer of blood and gore infused with negative energy. This gore allows the skeleton to reform and heal itself. In addition to the changes for the skeleton template, make the following adjustments to the base creature. Challenge Rating: As a normal skeleton + 1. Fast Healing: A bloody skeleton has fast healing equal to 1 per 2 Hit Dice it possesses (minimum 1). Saves: A bloody skeleton gains channel resistance +4. Abilities: A bloody skeleton's Charisma is 14. Special Qualities: A bloody skeleton gains the deathless special quality. Deathless (Su): A bloody skeleton is destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points, but it returns to unlife 1 hour later at 1 hit point, allowing its fast healing thereafter to resume healing it. A bloody skeleton can be permanently destroyed if it is destroyed by positive energy, if it is reduced to 0 hit points in the area of a bless or hallow spell, or if its remains are sprinkled with a vial of holy water. Burning Skeleton A burning skeleton is surrounded by an aura of flames that deals fire damage to those it strikes. In addition to the changes for the skeleton template, make the following adjustments to the base creature. Challenge Rating: As a normal skeleton + 1. Aura: Burning skeletons possess a fiery aura. Fiery Aura (Ex): Creatures adjacent to a burning skeleton take 1d6 points of fire damage at the start of their turn. Anyone striking a burning skeleton with an unarmed strike or natural attack takes 1d6 points of fire damage. Defensive Abilities: Burning skeletons lose their immunity to cold but gain immunity to fire. A burning skeleton gains vulnerability to cold damage. Melee Attacks: A burning skeleton's melee attacks (including both those made with a natural weapon and those made with a manufactured weapon) deal an additional 1d6 points of fire damage. Abilities: A burning skeleton's Charisma is 12. Special Qualities: A burning skeleton gains fiery death. Fiery Death (Su): A burning skeleton explodes into a burst of flame when it dies. Anyone adjacent to the skeleton when it is destroyed takes 1d6 points of fire damage per 2 Hit Dice the skeleton possessed (minimum 1d6). A Ref lex save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the skeleton's Hit Dice + the skeleton's Cha bonus) halves this damage.","<link rel=""stylesheet""href=""PF.css""><div><h2>Skeleton </h2><h3><i>The pile of bones suddenly stirs, rising up to take on a human shape.

While the most commonly encountered zombies are slow and tough, others possess a variety of traits, allowing them to spread disease or move with increased speed. Zombies are unthinking automatons, and can do little more than follow orders. When left unattended, zombies tend to mill about in search of living creatures to slaughter and devour. Zombies attack until destroyed, having no regard for their own safety. Although capable of following orders, zombies are more often unleashed into an area with no command other than to kill living creatures. As a result, zombies are often encountered in packs, wandering around places the living frequent, looking for victims. Most zombies are created using animate dead. Such zombies are always of the standard type, unless the creator also casts haste or remove paralysis to create fast zombies, or contagion to create plague zombies. Creating a Zombie ""Zombie"" is an acquired template that can be added to any corporeal creature (other than an undead), referred to hereafter as the base creature. Challenge Rating: This depends on the creature's new total number of Hit Dice, as follows: HD CR XP 1/2 1/8 50 1 1/4 100 2 1/2 200 3-4 1 400 5-6 2 600 7-8 3 800 9-10 4 1,200 11-12 5 1,600 13-16 6 2,400 17-20 7 3,200 21-24 8 4,800 25-28 9 6,400 Alignment: Always neutral evil. Type: The creature's type changes to undead. It retains any subtype except for alignment subtypes (such as good) and subtypes that indicate kind. It does not gain the augmented subtype. It uses all the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here. Armor Class: Natural armor is based on the zombie's size: Zombie Size N atural Armor Bonus Tiny or smaller +0 Small +1 Medium +2 Large +3 Huge +4 Gargantuan +7 Colossal +11 Hit Dice: Drop HD gained from class levels (minimum of 1) and change racial HD to d8s. Zombies gain a number of additional HD as noted on the following table. Zombie Size Bonus Hit Dice Tiny or smaller - Small or Medium +1 HD Large +2 HD Huge +4 HD Gargantuan +6 HD Colossal +10 HD Zombies use their Charisma modifiers to determine bonus hit points (instead of Constitution). Saves: Base save bonuses are Fort +1/3 HD, Ref +1/3 HD, and Will +1/2 HD + 2. Defensive Abilities: Zombies lose their defensive abilities and gain all of the qualities and immunities granted by the undead type. Zombies gain DR 5/slashing. Speed: Winged zombies can still fly, but maneuverability drops to clumsy. If the base creature flew magically, so can the zombie. Retain all other movement types. Attacks: A zombie retains all the natural weapons, manufactured weapon attacks, and weapon prof iciencies of the base creature. It also gains a slam attack that deals damage based on the zombie's size, but as if it were one size category larger than its actual size (see pages 301-302). Special Attacks: A zombie retains none of the base creature's special attacks. Abilities: Str +2, Dex -2. A zombie has no Con or Int score, and its Wis and Cha become 10. BAB: A zombie's base attack is equal to 3/4 its Hit Dice. Skills: A zombie has no skill ranks. Feats: A zombie loses all feats possessed by the base creature, and does not gain feats as its Hit Dice increase, but it does gain Toughness as a bonus feat. Special Qualities: A zombie loses most special qualities of the base creature. It retains any extraordinary special qualities that improve its melee or ranged attacks. A zombie gains the following special quality. Staggered (Ex): Zombies have poor ref lexes and can only perform a single move action or standard action each round. A zombie can move up to its speed and attack in the same round as a charge action. Variant Zombies The typical zombie is a slow-moving abomination that is tough to destroy. Yet this tough zombie is not the only type of zombie to plague crypts or stalk graveyards. Each of the following two variant zombies modif ies the base zombie in a few simple ways. Fast Zombie Unlike the standard, plodding zombie, a fast zombie moves with a supernatural quickness. Speed: Increase the base creature's land speed by 10 feet. Defensive Abilities: A fast zombie does not gain DR 5/ slashing. Special Attacks: A fast zombie gains the following special attack. Quick Strikes (Ex): Whenever a fast zombie takes a fullattack action, it can make one additional slam attack at its highest base attack bonus. Abilities: As a standard zombie, except its Dexterity is increased by 2 instead of reduced by 2. Special Qualities: A fast zombie does not gain the staggered special quality. Plague Zombie These zombies carry a terrible disease that perpetuates their undead lineage-those infected by a plague zombie's contagion rise as zombies themselves when they perish. Defensive Abilities: A plague zombie does not gain DR 5/slashing. Special Attacks: A plague zombie gains the following special attacks. Death Burst (Ex): When a plague zombie dies, it explodes in a burst of decay. All creatures adjacent to the plague zombie are exposed to its plague as if struck by a slam attack and must make a Fortitude save or contract zombie rot. Disease (Su): The slam attack-as well as any other natural attacks-of a plague zombie carries the zombie rot disease. Zombie rot: slam; save Fort DC = 10 + 1/2 the zombie's Hit Dice + the zombie's Cha modif ier; onset 1d4 days; frequency 1/day; effect 1d2 Con, this damage cannot be healed while the creature is infected; cure 2 consecutive saves.

Such zombies are always of the standard type, unless the creator also casts haste or remove paralysis to create fast zombies, or contagion to create plague zombies.</p><p><b>Creating a Zombie</b><br> ""Zombie"" is an acquired template that can be added to any corporeal creature (other than an undead), referred to hereafter as the base creature.</p><p><b>Challenge Rating:</b> This depends on the creature's new total number of Hit Dice, as follows: <table>  <tr><th>HD</th><th>CR</th><th>XP</th></tr> <tr><td>1/2</td><td>1/8</td><td>50</td></tr> <tr><td>1</td><td>1/4</td><td>100</td></tr> <tr><td>2</td><td>1/2</td><td>200</td></tr> <tr><td>3-4</td><td>1</td><td>400</td></tr> <tr><td>5-6</td><td>2</td><td>600</td></tr> <tr><td>7-8</td><td>3</td><td>800</td></tr> <tr><td>9-10</td><td>4</td><td>1,200</td></tr> <tr><td>11-12</td><td>5</td><td>1,600</td></tr> <tr><td>13-16</td><td>6</td><td>2,400</td></tr> <tr><td>17-20</td><td>7</td><td>3,200</td></tr> <tr><td>21-24</td><td>8</td><td>4,800</td></tr> <tr><td>25-28</td><td>9</td><td>6,400</td></tr> </table>  <b>Alignment:</b> Always neutral evil.</p><p><b>Type:</b> The creature's type changes to undead.

Related to deer, elk prove important parts of many ecologies, being able to fend off or flee many threats while feeding greater predators. Their size, strength, and antlers-reaching up to 10 feet wide on some males- allow them to contend with most of their environment's dangers, though herds generally favor flight to combat. Elk also prove exceptionably adaptable and remarkable survivors, capable of living through severe changes in weather and in a variety of environments without concern. Many humanoid cultures rely on elk herds, using them as valued food sources, work animals, and companions. Most breeds of elk stand between 3 and 5 feet tall and weigh between 350 and 550 pounds, with females being far slighter than males. Heartier stock, such as the river elk seen throughout the River Kingdoms, Brevoy, and much of northern Avistan and Iobaria, grow to approximately 6 feet tall and weigh between 700 and 1,100 pounds. In some secluded wilds, primeval megaloceros-massive ancestors of the elk-still flourish, standing up to 9 feet tall, with bulks of 1,500 pounds and antlers growing over 12 feet wide. In all species, only male elk grow antlers. Female elk have the same statistics as males, but lack the gore or powerful charge attacks. Ecology Elk live relatively long lives for herd animals, with some bulls living for over 15 years. Physiologically, they're similar to deer and other grazing animals with their patterns of travel and interaction with other creatures. Because of their size, though, they can damage an ecosystem, eating great amounts of food and sometimes competing with other herbivores for resources. Bull elk keep their antlers for about 7 to 8 months of the year, maintaining them as a primary form of defense. The antlers of common elk stand 4 feet tall and spread about 6 feet wide. Both bulls and cows are quite strong, their kicks proving deadly deterrents against many would-be attackers. Most breeds of elk stay in herds with upwards of 50 members. Herd members actively protect each other, doing what they can to defend those incapable of fleeing, yet also recognizing hopeless causes. Very few predators can stand up to a group of defensive elk, though wolves, bears, boars, and hunting cats often attack the young, sick, or unwary who venture away from the herd. While most natural predators steer clear of elk herds, many humanoid or monstrous hunters manage to pick off elk by relying on ranged weapons or great physical prowess. Habitat & Society During most of the year, elk maintain large groups of their own genders. Cows and the young tend to stick near dens, so bulls are more likely to be found wandering their wide territories. During mating season, a dominant bull maintains a harem of as many as 20 cows. Any threat to that establishment is met with violent force, with battles between rivals often resulting in fierce clashing of antlers and contests of strength-though such rarely prove deadly. During mating season, cows don't always produce offspring, though when they do, typically only one or two elk are born. After mating season, cows care for calves for only a short time. Most are only nursed for a couple of months before they join with the rest of the herd. Elk are hibernating creatures, being almost unheard of during the winter season. During the remainder of the year, they roam and graze widely. When they make their tell-tale noise (called bugling,) it booms and echoes for miles, and females often consider the loudest males the most suitable as mates. Elk migrate throughout the year, typically to avoid the snow. They move from low to high ground, where tree bark is an abundant food source. During the summer months, they graze on the grasses they can find. During dry seasons, elk often make great trips to find abundant food sources, which can sometimes force out lesser creatures from a habitat. Elk are also know to vary widely from region to region. Common in Brevoy, the River Kingdoms, and secluded spots of Numeria, river elks prove larger and heartier than most of their brethren. Named for their tendencies to travel along rivers and the comfort with which they enter water, these elk exhibit a daring unknown to most other breeds, the bulls willingly fighting to defend their herds from any perceived threats. Megaloceros Similar in form to the elk but far superior in size is the megaloceros. The average male is a towering, dangerous creature with antlers that can alone weigh nearly 100 pounds. Unlike elk, megaloceros antlers are decidedly enormous and sometimes wider than their bodies are long. This leads to common misconceptions and exaggerations about the creature's monstrous size. Conveniently for those pursued, megaloceros males have difficultly navigating thickly forested areas, making them natives of plains and the woods' edge.

The traditional minotaur's lair is a maze, be it a legitimate labyrinth constructed to baff le and confuse, an accidental one such as a city sewer system, or a naturally occurring one such as a tangle of caverns and other underground passageways. Employing their innate cunning, minotaurs use their maze lairs to vex unwary foes who seek them out or who simply stumble into the lairs and become lost, slowly hunting the intruders as they try in vain to find a way out. Only when despair has truly set in does the minotaur move in to strike at its lost victims. When dealing with a group, minotaurs often let one creature escape, to spread the tale of horror and lure others to their mazes in hope of slaying the beasts. Of course, to minotaurs, these would-be heroes make for delicious meals.  Minotaurs might also be found in the employ of a more powerful monster or evil creature, serving it so long as they can still hunt and dine as they please. Usually this means guarding some powerful object or valuable location, but it can also be a sort of mercenary work, hunting down the foes of its master.  Minotaurs are relatively straightforward combatants, using their horns to horribly gore the nearest living creature when combat begins.","<link rel=""stylesheet""href=""PF.css""><div><h2>Minotaur</h2><h3><i>With the body of a powerfully built man and the head of a snarling bull, this creature stomps its hooves as if preparing to charge.</i></h3><br></br></div><div class=""heading""><p class=""alignleft"">Minotaur</p><p class=""alignright"">CR 4</p><div style=""clear: both;""></div></div><div><h5><b>XP </b>1,200</h5><h5>CE Large monstrous humanoid </h5><h5><b>Init </b>+0; <b>Senses </b>darkvision 60 ft.; Perception +10</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>DEFENSE</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>AC </b>14, touch 9, flat-footed 14 (+5 natural, -1 size)</h5><h5><b>hp </b>45 (6d10+12)</h5><h5><b>Fort </b>+6, <b>Ref </b>+5, <b>Will </b>+5</h5><h5><b>Defensive Abilities </b>natural cunning</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>OFFENSE</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Spd </b>30 ft.</h5><h5><b>Melee </b>greataxe +9/+4 (3d6+6/x3) and</br> gore +4 (1d6+4)</h5><h5><b>Space </b>10 ft.; <b>Reach </b>10 ft.</h5><h5><b>Special Attacks </b>powerful charge (gore +11, 2d6+6)</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>STATISTICS</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Str</b> 19, <b>Dex</b> 10, <b>Con</b> 15, <b>Int</b> 7, <b>Wis</b> 10, <b>Cha</b> 8</h5><h5><b>Base Atk </b>+6; <b>CMB </b>+11; <b>CMD </b>21</h5><h5><b>Feats </b>Great Fortitude, Improved Bull Rush, Power Attack</h5><h5><b>Skills </b>Intimidate +5, Perception +10, Stealth +2, Survival +10; <b>Racial Modifiers </b>+4 Perception, +4 Survival</h5><h5><b>Languages </b>Giant</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>ECOLOGY</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Environment </b> temperate ruins or underground</h5><h5><b>Organization </b>solitary, pair, or gang (3-4)</h5><h5><b>Treasure </b>standard (greataxe, other treasure)</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>SPECIAL ABILITIES</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Natural Cunning (Ex)</b> Although minotaurs are not especially intelligent, they possess innate cunning and logical ability.

Ironically, in many cases morlocks worship the statues left behind by these ancestors as their gods. Morlock priests of such ancestor worship have access to the domains of Darkness, Earth, Madness, and Strength. A typical morlock stands just over 5 feet tall and weighs roughly 150 pounds.  Morlocks move about on two legs at times, but often drop down to a creepy four-limbed shuff le when speed or stealth is necessary. Their wiry, often emaciated frames mask the strength of their limbs and their swift reactions.  Morlocks typically give birth to broods of three to four babies at a time, ravenous creatures born with a full set of teeth and a cannibalistic predisposition. The first few weeks of a brood's life must be carefully mothered to prevent attrition-it usually takes that long for the morlock young to overcome their natural inclination to feed on whatever is closest. Morlocks mature quickly, achieving adulthood after only 5 years of life. A typical morlock can live to a ripe old age of 60-although the majority of their kind die far sooner than that due to violence.","<link rel=""stylesheet""href=""PF.css""><div><h2>Morlock</h2><h3><i>Skin pale as a slug's belly, eyes huge and bulging, this thing crawls down the wall like a spider, but its shape is hideously humanoid.</i></h3><br></br></div><div class=""heading""><p class=""alignleft"">Morlock</p><p class=""alignright"">CR 2</p><div style=""clear: both;""></div></div><div><h5><b>XP </b>600</h5><h5>CE Medium monstrous humanoid </h5><h5><b>Init </b>+8; <b>Senses </b>darkvision 120 ft., scent; Perception +2</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>DEFENSE</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>AC </b>15, touch 14, flat-footed 11 (+4 Dex, +1 natural)</h5><h5><b>hp </b>22 (3d10+6)</h5><h5><b>Fort </b>+3, <b>Ref </b>+9, <b>Will </b>+5</h5><h5><b>Immune </b>disease, poison</h5><h5><b>Weaknesses </b>light blindness</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>OFFENSE</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Spd </b>40 ft., climb 30 ft.</h5><h5><b>Melee </b>club +5 (1d6+2), bite +0 (1d4+1)</h5><h5><b>Special Attacks </b>leap attack, sneak attack +1d6, swarming</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>STATISTICS</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Str</b> 14, <b>Dex</b> 19, <b>Con</b> 15, <b>Int</b> 5, <b>Wis</b> 14, <b>Cha</b> 6</h5><h5><b>Base Atk </b>+3; <b>CMB </b>+5; <b>CMD </b>19</h5><h5><b>Feats </b>Improved Initiative, Lightning Reflexes</h5><h5><b>Skills </b>Acrobatics +13, Climb +22, Stealth +8 (+12 in caverns); <b>Racial Modifiers </b>+4 Stealth in caverns, +8 Acrobatics, +16 Climb</h5><h5><b>Languages </b>Undercommon</h5><h5><b>SQ </b>expert climber</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>ECOLOGY</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Environment </b> any underground</h5><h5><b>Organization </b>solitary, pair, band (3-6), or tribe (7-18)</h5><h5><b>Treasure </b>standard</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>SPECIAL ABILITIES</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Expert Climber (Ex)</b> A morlock can cling to cave walls and even ceilings as long as the surface has hand- and footholds.

Often, a nalfeshnee's realm in the Abyss surpasses the strength and size of the largest of mortal kingdoms, for nalfeshnees display a singular gift for managing and ordering the chaos of the Abyss. Mortal summoners often seek them out for their unparalleled yet mad intellects, ever taking care to comb through bargains with such demons for hidden and unwanted consequences, for there is little a nalfeshnee will agree to do that does not, in some sinister way, advance the needs and desires of the Abyss.</p><p>Nalfeshnees stand 20 feet tall and weigh 8,000 pounds.</p><p>They form from the souls of greedy or avaricious evil mortals, particularly those who ruled over empires of slavery, theft, banditry, and more violent vices.</p></h4></div>",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,NULL,NULL,NULL

See in Darkness (Su) Nihilois can see perfectly in darkness of any kind, even that created by a deeper darkness spell.  Shadow Crafting (Sp) Five times per day, when in an area of dim light or darkness, a nihiloi can manipulate shadow to reproduce an effect identical to shadow evocation.

The save DC is Constitution-based.","Violent xenophobes, the creatures typically called nihilois, devashades, or shadow lords pose a rising threat to interlopers into their umbral realm. In ages immemorial, these creatures enjoyed vast empires upon the mysterious Plane of Shadow, but through the millennia incursion by immigrants and interlopers have eroded their way of life and scattered their numbers. In the face of spellcasters from the Material Plane striding across their homeland-using it as little more than a umbral thoroughfare-and whole terrible races like kytons migrating to their native reaches, the nihilois have long retreated into the deepest darknesses of their realm. Yet as alien encroachment continues, slowly the nihilois have revealed themselves, and found to their surprise that they are powerful and feared.  Nihilois-as the first travelers from Golarion termed them, believing them to be members of an ancient mythical race-resemble gaunt, vaguely humanoid creatures shrouded in ever-writhing shadow stuff with fountains of dark tendrils jutting from their backs. They often hold these thin limbs in tight bunches that appear like strange, dense wings, but unfurl them easily and with shocking speed to lash out against their enemies.  Unable to vocalize words, nihilois are widely distrusted by creatures foreign to the Plane of Shadow. Even a pair of the shadowy natives is unsettling to those encountering them for the first time as they silently gesture and nod, holding secret councils few others can understand.  Creatures frequently interacting with them know the nihilois have a shared name for their race, though since these creatures speak only telepathically, the term sounds more like the passage of massive wings than a word pronounceable in most sentient tongues.  Ecology Artisans of the Plane of Shadow, with a near-peerless understanding of that realm, nihilois can, like sculptors, twist and manipulate the very fabric of their home plane. Birthed from the dark plane, these natives are as true inhabitants of their realms as the denizens of the Material Plane are of theirs. The ever-changing gloom of the plane permeates these creatures, and they likewise prove dark and changeable. Yet as the nature of shadow is to flee from the light, so too do nihilois find it natural to retreat from interlopers into their realm.  Having done so since times unrecorded, only in recent centuries has a new sentiment grown among these shadow lords, a feeling that they are losing an important battle and that both their survival and their realm are threatened. Thus, slowly over the span of centuries, resistance to foreign invaders has gradually become a hallmark of this mysterious race.  Nihilois, both male and female, stand nearly 7 feet tall, but often raise themselves up off the ground on coils of their dark tendrils. Those thick bunches of thin limbs that extend from their backs they typically hold together in dense clusters, causing them to appear like wings, but can unravel them and bring them to bear with incredible swiftness. Having a highly malleable form, nihilois are light, weighing an average of 65 pounds.  When angered, they can temporarily inflate themselves to appear larger, whipping their tendrils around in a fierce display. In addition to serving as weapons and locomotion, nihiloi tentacles are used to feed as well. When tightly wrapped around or within a meal, the tendrils secrete a digestive acid and absorb nutrients through tiny openings.  Habitat & Society Nihilois prove exceedingly rare, most having retreated to the farthest-flung depths of the Plane of Shadow where their numbers have dwindled. With rising frequency, though, many have shrugged off their race's fear of interlopers and come to lurk in the shadow reflections of cities on the Material Plane. In such eerie metropolises, groups of nihilois form tightly knit cells, with small groups potentially claiming districts as their own or splitting entire shadow cities between themselves. Quick to influence and master lesser shadow creatures-such as shadows, shadow garms, and fetchlings- nihilois can draw surprisingly large populations of shadow creatures to a single location. While large clusters of such beings don't overtly threaten the Material Plane, such is true only so long as the natives of that plane stay within their realm. Those spellcasters who step from their city homes onto the Plane of Shadow might find the land far less deserted than is typical for the plane, a realm of living shadow and hostile, glowing eyes. Outside such cities or group settings, lone nihilois hunt down interlopers into their realm, shadowing trespassers until the time is right to strike. While slaying such intruders satisfies their need for vengeance, all nihilois also seek out portals leading onto the Plane of Shadow and destroy such passages however they can, striving toward a day when all know to avoid the nighted realm.","<link rel=""stylesheet""href=""PF.css""><div><h2>Nihiloi</h2><h3><i>A mass of black, bramble-like tentacles writhes from the back of this vague, shifting humanoid.

A bard who has a nymph for a muse in this way can use his bardic performance for an additional number of rounds per day equal to his nymph muse's Charisma modifier.

Those who look directly at a nymph must succeed on a DC 21 Fortitude save or be blinded permanently. A nymph can suppress or resume this ability as a free action. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </h5><h5><b>Inspiration (Su)</b> A nymph can choose an intelligent creature to inspire and serve as a muse by giving that creature some token of her affection (typically a lock of her hair).  As long as the nymph retains her favor for this creature and as long as the creature carries the nymph's token, the creature gains a +4 insight bonus on all Will saving throws, Craft checks, and Perform checks. A bard who has a nymph for a muse in this way can use his bardic performance for an additional number of rounds per day equal to his nymph muse's Charisma modifier. The nymph retains a link to her token and its carrier as if she had cast a status spell on the carrier. The nymph can end this effect at any time as a free action. A single nymph may only inspire one creature at a time in this manner.  </h5><h5><b>Spells</b> A nymph casts spells as a 7th-level druid, but cannot swap out prepared spells to cast summon spells.  </h5><h5><b>Stunning Glance (Su)</b> As a standard action, a nymph can stun a creature within 30 feet with a look. The target must succeed on a DC 21 Fortitude save or be stunned for 2d4 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </h5><h5><b>Unearthly Grace (Su)</b> A nymph adds her Charisma modifier as a racial bonus on all her saving throws, and as a deflection bonus to her Armor Class.  </h5><h5><b>Wild Empathy (Su)</b> This works like the druid's wild empathy class feature, except the nymph has a +6 racial bonus on the check.

Other types of oni exist as well-evil spirits that clothe themselves in the flesh of other types of humanoid.

However, most concur that at some point in the distant past, a deranged wizard created the original specimens by crossing an owl with a bear-perhaps as proof of some insane concept about the nature of life, but possibly out of sheer lunacy.  Whatever the original purpose of such a freakish creation as the owlbear, the creature bred true and has become quite wellestablished in woodlands across the world, where it plays a key role in a region's ecosystem as an apex predator.  Owlbears are notoriously bloodthirsty killers, well known for their short tempers, aggression, and savage nature. They tend to attack without provocation, slaughtering any living creatures that cross their paths.  Many scholars that have encountered these creatures in the wild have noted that they all have red-rimmed eyes that roll about wildly when they close in for an attack. This is sometimes presented as a sign of madness, suggesting that all owlbears are born with a pathological need to fight and kill, but more level-headed researchers believe that it's simply part of the way the massive bird-beast's keen eyes are constructed.  Owlbears generally inhabit desolate areas of the wilderness, making their messy lairs within wild forests or inside dark, shallow caverns. They are equally adept at hunting during the day and at night, depending upon the prey available near their lairs.  Adult owlbears live in mated pairs, and hunt in small groups, leaving their young behind in their lairs while they search for prey. A typical owlbear lair contains 1d6 juveniles, which can fetch a price of up to 3,000 gp apiece in many city markets.

They tend to attack without provocation, slaughtering any living creatures that cross their paths.</p><p>Many scholars that have encountered these creatures in the wild have noted that they all have red-rimmed eyes that roll about wildly when they close in for an attack. This is sometimes presented as a sign of madness, suggesting that all owlbears are born with a pathological need to fight and kill, but more level-headed researchers believe that it's simply part of the way the massive bird-beast's keen eyes are constructed.</p><p>Owlbears generally inhabit desolate areas of the wilderness, making their messy lairs within wild forests or inside dark, shallow caverns. They are equally adept at hunting during the day and at night, depending upon the prey available near their lairs.</p><p>Adult owlbears live in mated pairs, and hunt in small groups, leaving their young behind in their lairs while they search for prey. A typical owlbear lair contains 1d6 juveniles, which can fetch a price of up to 3,000 gp apiece in many city markets.</p><p>While it is considered impossible to truly domesticate owlbears due to their feral natures, they can still be used as guardians if contained within an area but allowed to roam and hunt freely there.

Viewing themselves as true and regal dragons, these brutes seek to dominate swampy or overgrown territories but a few miles wide, driving off other creatures and despoiling the land as they please. Often their lands become littered with traces of their passage: great footprints in muddy banks, felled trees, and rotted corpses riddled with peludas' lance-like quills. Although most think themselves clever, peludas swiftly grow tired of tactics and debate, and it often takes little more than the suggestion of a trespasser to make them run amuck. Elder peludas often appear far bulkier than their bare physical frames would suggest. As the majority of their roughly serpentine bodies bristle with lengthy quills, they look to be far stouter than they truly are with their naked reptilian necks, tails, and feet sprouting from a forest of deadly barbs. A typical 15-foot-long adult peluda can raise its head up to 8 feet off the ground and weighs approximately 300 pounds. Ecology Peludas have a voracious appetite, gorging themselves on all manner of beasts drawn to the rivers, marshlands, and wild plains where they live. Much like a snake, these creatures can unhinge their lower jaw to swallow larger prey after pulverizing it with blows from their massive tail. They prefer to do so, however, after roasting their meal with their fiery breath. Peludas fear nothing smaller than themselves and routinely bring down larger prey even at a short distance with volleys of their poisonous quills. Their dangerous hide also acts as a defense to ward off gigantic predators like rocs or even true dragons, making peludas an unappetizing-and poisonous-meal at best. Although most peludas prefer the cool darkness of reedy marshlands-especially sparsely forested bogs, as their quills can make navigating dense overgrowth frustrating-peludas occasionally venture further inland to enhance their diets, feeding on the livestock, crops, and people of rural communities. They see these excursions as nothing more than brief hunting sorties, often with the opportunity to cruelly ruin the fragile works of lesser creatures. Peludas lay small clutches of eggs that never result in more than two or three young at a time. Ensuring that such limited numbers of offspring reach maturity presents a significant challenge for these violent creatures, as just as many of these young, bald peludas fall to the tempers of their parents as to attacks from interlopers or other beasts. Habitat & Society Peludas often lair in caves, either caverns half-submerged in bogs or cool rents in the earth. While not exceptionally intelligent compared to other dragons, peludas possess a heightened survival instinct and a penchant for collecting interesting shards of metal from tools, armor, and weapons taken from their victims. They also swallow shiny coins, gems, and jewelry, believing it helps strengthen their quills and the potency of their fiery breath. Occasionally a particularly cunning tribe of savage humanoids-typically lizardfolk or orcs-finds a way to assuage the temper of a peluda that lairs nearby, elevating the creature to the status of a local liege or deity. Whether the tribe believes in the dragon-kin's lordly status varies from community to community, though all pay the more powerful creature deference and many provide offerings of captives and wealth. Although peludas rarely have any actual affection for such servants-and more than one tribe has been scoured from the land in a random fit of flaming temper-all revel in the submission of weaker creatures and the gifts of gold and food they bring, as such deeds act as a balm to their typically fragile draconic egos. As nearly all peluda dwell on the fact that they lack the fearsomeness and power of true dragons, they do all they can to exhibit their ferocity and might. While the destruction they cause and the subservience of weaker creatures indulges peludas' fragile delusions, any suggestion that they are not every bit as mighty as their draconic peers-especially from those they view as lesser creatures-throws them into a rage few provokers can hope to survive.","<link rel=""stylesheet""href=""PF.css""><div><h2>Peluda</h2><h3><i><i>Shuffling forward on thunderous elephantine limbs comes an immense dragon-like beast.

When prey is located, the spider shifts to the Ethereal Plane to prepare an ambush. Against a lone victim, the spider shifts to the Material Plane, bites the victim, then retreats back to the Ethereal Plane to wait for the poison to take effect. Against multiple foes, a phase spider follows these same tactics, and on each round a foe remains in reach at the start of its turn, it repeats this gambit. If no foes are in reach, it moves while ethereal to prepare an attack on an available target, but unless it feels safe in spending an entire round on the Material, it won't phase back to attack unless it can do so while saving a move action for an escape.  Phase spiders are the natural enemy of another denizen of the Ethereal Plane-the xill. The two races have long fought a bloody war with no real prospect of a resolution anytime soon. Were phase spiders less horrifying and alien in appearance, they might find the allies they need to defeat the sinister xill among other races, but their monstrous forms and often overwhelming hunger make diplomacy difficult.  On the Ethereal Plane, phase spiders can manipulate the raw smoky ether in a manner similar to how a spider manipulates webs.

Against multiple foes, a phase spider follows these same tactics, and on each round a foe remains in reach at the start of its turn, it repeats this gambit.

For example, a typical 20 Hit Dice pit fiend could transform 20 lemures into two bone devils (10 HD each), or three bearded devils (6 HD each, leaving two lemures unchanged), or any other combination of lesser devils. Lemures to be reshaped must be within 50 feet of the pit fiend, becoming stationary and unable to move once the shaping begins. After a minute passes, the lemures reform into the shape of a new lesser devil ready to follow the orders of the pit fiend.

Massive, physically indomitable, and possessed of ingenious evil intellects, these diabolical tyrants hold great autonomy whether in their service to the archf iends, in their rule of vast infernal fiefdoms, or in subjugation of mortal worlds. Thick muscles cling to their gigantic frames, armored over by dense, bladed scales capable of def lecting all but the most potent assaults. Fangs as thick as daggers fill their maws, bestial visages disguising some of the most insidious minds in Hell. Born within the depths of Nessus, the ninth and deepest layer of Hell, pit fiends are raised from the ranks of cornugons and gelugons by the archdevils and their dukes alone. While many travel to higher layers and far from Hell to command infernal legions, most remain in Nessus serving in the courts of Hell's elite or in dark councils with unknowable purposes. Pit fiends always stand over 14 feet tall, with wingspans in excess of 20 feet and weights over 1,000 pounds. Pit fiends are masters of fire and prefer lands bathed in flame. In Hell, this predisposes them to Avernus, Dis, Malebolge, Nessus, and Phlegethon the layers most likely to harbor their burning temple-citadels. Fanatics obsessed with diabolical superiority and ironclad obedience, pit fiends left to their own devices raise massive armies, scouring the pits of Hell for the most depraved lemures to transform into true fiends. When convinced they've formed the perfect legions, they turn their attentions to vulnerable demiplanes and mortal worlds, eyeing them for infernal domination and the glory of conquest. In the service of the archfiends or other unique infernal warlords, pit fiends hold themselves to a greater cause, obeying the wills of Asmodeus's chosen nobles in the hopes of one day garnering the favor of either the Prince of Darkness or Hell itself. While obedient to the hierarchies of their kind, they are also strict in their enforcement, and should a pit fiend find itself subservient to a master unfit to rule, it holds itself duty bound to cast down such an incompetent lord. Thus, whether as masters or servants, pit fiends embody the will of Hell's merciless law and assure that only the strongest of devilkind flourish (or dare to). Only the most powerful of mortal spellcasters can or dare summon a pit fiend. These devils' reactions to summoning are deliberate and swift, usually typified by overwhelming rage that such insignificant beings would waste their immortal time. Those that cannot weather the devils' burning rage are slain-their souls typically racing the pit fiends back to Hell. Those who manage to keep control of the greater devils, though, intrigue them. A pit fiend might dutifully serve a mortal master for centuries, but its goal is always the same: to further corrupt the mortal soul, assure its absolute damnation, and when the mortal inevitably dies, claim its soul and begin the process of creating a perfectly corrupt lemure servant. Pit fiends know they are immortal and are intelligent enough to indulge in impossibly disciplined patience. As such, the eldest pit fiends see in their legions the faces of countless fools who once presumed themselves the devils' masters. Infernal Dukes The most powerful of pit fiends are lords in their own right-members of the elite caste of infernal politics and leadership known as the Dukes of Hell. While not all of the Dukes of Hell are pit fiends, the majority of them are. As a general rule, a pit fiend Duke of Hell has several levels of a particular character class, the advanced simple template, or in some cases unusual spell-like abilities or unique powers over and above those of most pit fiends. Listed here are three sample unique pit fiend duke abilities, but these examples are by no means the entirety of what strange powers an infernal duke might wield. Deathmastery (Su): The pit fiend duke's ability to manipulate the souls of the damned extends beyond the standard devil shaping power. Whenever a pit fiend slays a humanoid, it can attempt to transform the slain creature's soul into a ghost under the pit fiend's control. The pit fiend may control a number of ghosts in this manner equal to its Charisma modifier. Master of Magic (Su): The pit fiend duke has additional spell-like abilities (20 spell levels' worth of 1st-4th level spells usable at will and 20 spell levels' worth of 5th-8th level spells usable 3 times a day). Hellfire Breath (Su): The pit fiend gains a devastating breath weapon that it can use once every 1d4 rounds. This breath weapon is a 60-foot cone of fire (10d10 fire damage and 10d10 unholy damage as per flame strike, successful Ref lex save [DC 10 + 1/2 the pit fiend's racial HD + the pit fiend's Constitution modifier] half ).","<link rel=""stylesheet""href=""PF.css""><div><h2>Devil, Pit Fiend </h2><h3><i>A pair of gigantic, flame-seared wings and eyes smoldering like embers give this towering devil a truly horrific appearance.</i></h3><br></br></div><div class=""heading""><p class=""alignleft"">Pit Fiend</p><p class=""alignright"">CR 20</p><div style=""clear: both;""></div></div><div><h5><b>XP </b>307,200</h5><h5>LE Large outsider (devil, evil, extraplanar, lawful)</h5><h5><b>Init </b>+13; <b>Senses </b>darkvision 60 ft., see in darkness; Perception +33</h5><h5><b>Aura </b>fear (20 ft., DC 23)</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>DEFENSE</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>AC </b>38, touch 18, flat-footed 29 (+9 Dex, +20 natural, -1 size)</h5><h5><b>hp </b>350 (20d10+240)</h5><h5><b>Fort </b>+24, <b>Ref </b>+21, <b>Will </b>+18</h5><h5><b>DR </b>15/good and silver; <b>Immune </b>fire, poison; <b>Resist </b>acid 10, cold 10; <b>SR </b>31</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>OFFENSE</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Spd </b>40 ft., fly 60 ft.

This breath weapon is a 60-foot cone of fire (10d10 fire damage and 10d10 unholy damage as per flame strike, successful Ref lex save [DC 10 + 1/2 the pit fiend's racial HD + the pit fiend's Constitution modifier] half ).</p></h4></div>",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,NULL,NULL,NULL

Once pixie dust is applied to an arrow, the pixie's chosen effect persists on the arrow for only 1 round.

They often only vocalize in chirps, hisses, growls, and purrs, but can communicate telepathically with any intelligent creature. If approached peacefully and offered food, they are usually willing to share information about what they've seen in their territory, but threats or violence make them flee.  Pseudodragons are carnivores, devouring insects, rodents, small birds, and snakes, though they sometimes eat eggs, and most also enjoy butter, cheese, and fish. They either hunt on the ground like lizards or look for prey on the wing like a raptor. As smart as a typical humanoid, they do not enjoy being treated as pets and prefer being treated as friends. They are wary of evil folk but can bond with sorcerers and wizards as familiars, and some have befriended druids and rangers or partnered with good dragons as scouts. Pseudodragons will serve as familiars if they approve of a spellcaster's personality (and if the spellcaster takes the Improved Familiar feat), but often also bond with those whose company they enjoy or who have proven themselves true friends. A pseudodragon might follow another character in this manner for days, weeks, years, or even a lifetime if the creature is treated well, provided with food, and generally well-loved.

They often only vocalize in chirps, hisses, growls, and purrs, but can communicate telepathically with any intelligent creature. If approached peacefully and offered food, they are usually willing to share information about what they've seen in their territory, but threats or violence make them flee.</p><p>Pseudodragons are carnivores, devouring insects, rodents, small birds, and snakes, though they sometimes eat eggs, and most also enjoy butter, cheese, and fish. They either hunt on the ground like lizards or look for prey on the wing like a raptor. As smart as a typical humanoid, they do not enjoy being treated as pets and prefer being treated as friends. They are wary of evil folk but can bond with sorcerers and wizards as familiars, and some have befriended druids and rangers or partnered with good dragons as scouts. Pseudodragons will serve as familiars if they approve of a spellcaster's personality (and if the spellcaster takes the Improved Familiar feat), but often also bond with those whose company they enjoy or who have proven themselves true friends. A pseudodragon might follow another character in this manner for days, weeks, years, or even a lifetime if the creature is treated well, provided with food, and generally well-loved.</p><p>Upon reaching adulthood, a pseudodragon's body is about 1 foot long with a 2-foot tail, and weighs about 7 pounds.

It can suppress or resume this ability as a free action. When a rakshasa uses this ability, it always functions as if it had spent three rounds concentrating and thus gains the maximum amount of information possible. A creature can resist this effect with a DC 18 Will save. The save DC is Charisma-based.","The rakshasa is an evil spirit that cloaks itself in the guise of a humanoid creature that it might walk unseen among its prey. They embody what is taboo among most societies, and in the shape of those it seeks to defile, a rakshasa gorges itself on these hideous acts. Were they human, these acts of cannibalism, blasphemy, and worse would mark them as criminals condemned to the cruelest of hells.  When not disguised as a humanoid, the otherwise humanoid rakshasa has the head of an animal. Often, they possess the heads of great cats (such as a tiger or panther) or a snake (like a cobra or viper), yet other heads are not unknown-apes, jackals, vultures, elephants, mantises, lizards, rhinos, boars, and more are possible. In most cases, the type of head a rakshasa possesses speaks in some way to its personality-a tiger-headed rakshasa is stealthy and ravenous, while a boar-headed one might be gluttonous and crude. These changes rarely impact the rakshasa's base statistics, although there are more powerful variants of the standard rakshasa that possess multiple heads, more potent spellcasting powers, and additional deadly and unusual special abilities.  Rakshasas scoff at religion- they understand the power of the divine, but see themselves as the only thing worthy of worship from the mortal races.  Rakshasa clerics are thus quite rare.

Were they human, these acts of cannibalism, blasphemy, and worse would mark them as criminals condemned to the cruelest of hells.</p><p>When not disguised as a humanoid, the otherwise humanoid rakshasa has the head of an animal. Often, they possess the heads of great cats (such as a tiger or panther) or a snake (like a cobra or viper), yet other heads are not unknown-apes, jackals, vultures, elephants, mantises, lizards, rhinos, boars, and more are possible. In most cases, the type of head a rakshasa possesses speaks in some way to its personality-a tiger-headed rakshasa is stealthy and ravenous, while a boar-headed one might be gluttonous and crude. These changes rarely impact the rakshasa's base statistics, although there are more powerful variants of the standard rakshasa that possess multiple heads, more potent spellcasting powers, and additional deadly and unusual special abilities.</p><p>Rakshasas scoff at religion- they understand the power of the divine, but see themselves as the only thing worthy of worship from the mortal races.</p><p>Rakshasa clerics are thus quite rare.

The constructs also excel in tracking down specific objects and returning them to their masters-their intelligence is just enough to allow them to focus on their ordered tasks but not quite enough for them to form ideas of rebellion and longings for freedom.

Conjuring a Retriever Although a retriever is not an outsider, it may nonetheless be conjured by either greater planar ally or greater planar binding. The spellcaster must take care to do so, however, using special rare incenses and complex diagrams inked on the floor and walls using expensive phosphorescent inks, lest the retriever attack the spellcaster upon completion of the spell. These components cost 25,000 gp and replace the usual costs associated with casting either spell (including greater planar binding's Charisma check requirement).","<link rel=""stylesheet""href=""PF.css""><div><h2>Retriever</h2><h3><i>A spider the size of a bull elephant rears up on its back four legs in a violent challenge, eyes shimmering with magical energy.</i></h3><br></br></div><div class=""heading""><p class=""alignleft"">Retriever</p><p class=""alignright"">CR 11</p><div style=""clear: both;""></div></div><div><h5><b>XP </b>12,800</h5><h5>CE Huge construct (extraplanar)</h5><h5><b>Init </b>+7; <b>Senses </b>darkvision 60 ft., low-light vision, Perception +15</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>DEFENSE</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>AC </b>25, touch 11, flat-footed 22 (+3 Dex, +14 natural, -2 size)</h5><h5><b>hp </b>137 (15d10+55)</h5><h5><b>Fort </b>+7, <b>Ref </b>+10, <b>Will </b>+5</h5><h5><b>Defensive Abilities </b>construct traits</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>OFFENSE</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Spd </b>50 ft.</h5><h5><b>Melee </b>bite +19 (1d8+6 plus grab), 4 claws +19 (2d6+6/19-20)</h5><h5><b>Space </b>15 ft.; <b>Reach </b>15 ft.</h5><h5><b>Special Attacks </b>eye rays (+16 ranged touch)</h5><h5><b>Spell-Like Abilities</b> (CL 20th)</br>At will&mdash;<i>discern location</i></h5></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>STATISTICS</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Str</b> 22, <b>Dex</b> 16, <b>Con</b> -, <b>Int</b> 3, <b>Wis</b> 11, <b>Cha</b> 1</h5><h5><b>Base Atk </b>+15; <b>CMB </b>+23 (+27 grapple); <b>CMD </b>36 (40 vs. trip)</h5><h5><b>Feats </b>Cleave, Improved Bull Rush, Great Fortitude, Improved Critical (claw), Improved Initiative, Lightning Reflexes, Power Attack, Toughness</h5><h5><b>Skills </b>Perception +15</h5><h5><b>Languages </b>Abyssal (cannot speak)</h5><h5><b>SQ </b>relentless</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>ECOLOGY</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Environment </b> any (Abyss)</h5><h5><b>Organization </b>solitary</h5><h5><b>Treasure </b>none</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>SPECIAL ABILITIES</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Eye Rays (Su)</b> A retriever's eyes can produce four different magical rays, each with a range of 100 feet.

Often, the presence of a retriever in a demon's den is enough in and of itself to ensure the loyalty of the lesser demons. The constructs also excel in tracking down specific objects and returning them to their masters-their intelligence is just enough to allow them to focus on their ordered tasks but not quite enough for them to form ideas of rebellion and longings for freedom.</p><p>A retriever's body is the size of an elephant, and its legspan is nearly 30 feet. It weighs 6,500 pounds.</p><p><b>Conjuring a Retriever</b><br> Although a retriever is not an outsider, it may nonetheless be conjured by either greater planar ally or greater planar binding. The spellcaster must take care to do so, however, using special rare incenses and complex diagrams inked on the floor and walls using expensive phosphorescent inks, lest the retriever attack the spellcaster upon completion of the spell.</p><p>These components cost 25,000 gp and replace the usual costs associated with casting either spell (including greater planar binding's Charisma check requirement).</p></h4></div>",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,NULL,NULL,NULL

Related to deer, elk prove important parts of many ecologies, being able to fend off or flee many threats while feeding greater predators. Their size, strength, and antlers-reaching up to 10 feet wide on some males- allow them to contend with most of their environment's dangers, though herds generally favor flight to combat. Elk also prove exceptionably adaptable and remarkable survivors, capable of living through severe changes in weather and in a variety of environments without concern. Many humanoid cultures rely on elk herds, using them as valued food sources, work animals, and companions. Most breeds of elk stand between 3 and 5 feet tall and weigh between 350 and 550 pounds, with females being far slighter than males. Heartier stock, such as the river elk seen throughout the River Kingdoms, Brevoy, and much of northern Avistan and Iobaria, grow to approximately 6 feet tall and weigh between 700 and 1,100 pounds. In some secluded wilds, primeval megaloceros-massive ancestors of the elk-still flourish, standing up to 9 feet tall, with bulks of 1,500 pounds and antlers growing over 12 feet wide. In all species, only male elk grow antlers. Female elk have the same statistics as males, but lack the gore or powerful charge attacks. Ecology Elk live relatively long lives for herd animals, with some bulls living for over 15 years. Physiologically, they're similar to deer and other grazing animals with their patterns of travel and interaction with other creatures. Because of their size, though, they can damage an ecosystem, eating great amounts of food and sometimes competing with other herbivores for resources. Bull elk keep their antlers for about 7 to 8 months of the year, maintaining them as a primary form of defense. The antlers of common elk stand 4 feet tall and spread about 6 feet wide. Both bulls and cows are quite strong, their kicks proving deadly deterrents against many would-be attackers. Most breeds of elk stay in herds with upwards of 50 members. Herd members actively protect each other, doing what they can to defend those incapable of fleeing, yet also recognizing hopeless causes. Very few predators can stand up to a group of defensive elk, though wolves, bears, boars, and hunting cats often attack the young, sick, or unwary who venture away from the herd. While most natural predators steer clear of elk herds, many humanoid or monstrous hunters manage to pick off elk by relying on ranged weapons or great physical prowess. Habitat & Society During most of the year, elk maintain large groups of their own genders. Cows and the young tend to stick near dens, so bulls are more likely to be found wandering their wide territories. During mating season, a dominant bull maintains a harem of as many as 20 cows. Any threat to that establishment is met with violent force, with battles between rivals often resulting in fierce clashing of antlers and contests of strength-though such rarely prove deadly. During mating season, cows don't always produce offspring, though when they do, typically only one or two elk are born. After mating season, cows care for calves for only a short time. Most are only nursed for a couple of months before they join with the rest of the herd. Elk are hibernating creatures, being almost unheard of during the winter season. During the remainder of the year, they roam and graze widely. When they make their tell-tale noise (called bugling,) it booms and echoes for miles, and females often consider the loudest males the most suitable as mates. Elk migrate throughout the year, typically to avoid the snow. They move from low to high ground, where tree bark is an abundant food source. During the summer months, they graze on the grasses they can find. During dry seasons, elk often make great trips to find abundant food sources, which can sometimes force out lesser creatures from a habitat. Elk are also know to vary widely from region to region. Common in Brevoy, the River Kingdoms, and secluded spots of Numeria, river elks prove larger and heartier than most of their brethren. Named for their tendencies to travel along rivers and the comfort with which they enter water, these elk exhibit a daring unknown to most other breeds, the bulls willingly fighting to defend their herds from any perceived threats. Megaloceros Similar in form to the elk but far superior in size is the megaloceros. The average male is a towering, dangerous creature with antlers that can alone weigh nearly 100 pounds. Unlike elk, megaloceros antlers are decidedly enormous and sometimes wider than their bodies are long. This leads to common misconceptions and exaggerations about the creature's monstrous size. Conveniently for those pursued, megaloceros males have difficultly navigating thickly forested areas, making them natives of plains and the woods' edge.

A typical roc is 30 feet long from beak to tail, with an 80- foot wingspan and weight of up to 8,000 pounds. While their beaks are hooked like an eagle's and designed for slashing and tearing, most rocs prefer to seize prey in their massive, clawed talons and drop them from great heights before feasting on the shattered remains. For this reason, they are often followed by flocks of scavengers like rooks, buzzards, and eagles hoping to steal portions of the roc's messy meals. The roc generally ignores such opportunists, but if the scavengers don't take care, they nevertheless may find themselves accidentally consumed by the feeding roc. Rocs are equally comfortable over land and sea. While they are capable of sleeping in the air as they soar solo across great ranges in search of food, they generally return home to the mountains to roost and procreate. They prefer rocky crags that are completely inaccessible by terrestrial means, building vast nests of tree trunks and ruined masonry. Once a decade, a mated pair lays a clutch of 3-5 eggs and raises its young. Outside of mating, rocs are extremely antisocial, and may attack others of their kind in vicious aerial battles in order to establish their territorial boundaries. When a nest contains eggs or chicks, parents trade off in their long-ranging flights, with one restricting its wanderings to within a 10-mile radius of the nest. Rocs are most commonly white but can be a number of different colors, from dark brown or gold to black or blood red. Their massive feathers are highly prized, and their eggs even more so. Due to their scarcity and the high risk involved in harvesting them, a single man-sized roc egg can net 4,000 gp if transported to market undamaged.

Known as ""wretch worms"" and ""eyes of Orv,"" these disgusting abominations writhe through flooded pits and crevices, feeding upon nearly all they encounter and occasionally breaking forth from the depths into the world of light to glut themselves upon the plump, tender creatures found there. Rorkouns measure over 25 feet in length, and beneath the strange secretions that provide them with a false, apparent bulk, the creatures possess a ribbon-thin body only a foot wide. A typical rorkoun weighs a mere 200 pounds. Ecology Little is known of the anatomy and life processes of rorkouns because of both their rarity and their fundamental dependency on water. As soon as a rorkoun leaves the water-which none ever do willingly, even to pursue the most tempting prey-it begins dehydrating at a deadly rate. Most that are ripped from their native pools wither to long strips of jerky-like flesh in a few short minutes. Thus, much of what is known of the beasts comes from direct observation, a methodology that proves dangerous for most researchers. Rorkouns possess lengthy bodies similar to tapeworms, with simple, decentralized bodily systems. Their flat, oblong heads branch into four split mouthparts set on throat-like stalks. At the top of the head, a single, bulging eye scans the creature's surroundings with uncanny sensitivity. Their heads are the thickest parts of their bodies, which taper gradually to a powerful tail. The strangest quality of these creatures is that their body exudes a rubbery, gluelike substance that swiftly hardens into a flexible, puttylike mass. Rorkouns use these secretions to better protect their bodies, seal off their chosen lairs (to prevent water from seeping out), and capture their prey. Several explorers who have encountered rorkouns have spread unnerving stories regarding the beasts, suggesting that rorkouns are not individual creatures but rather the impossibly long appendages of some unknown aberrant body. Their hesitance to leave the water is thus claimed to be because they are incapable of separating themselves from their greater body; the frantic thrashing of rorkoun that are forcibly removed from the water as they struggle to return is compared to the final desperate twitches of an amputated limb. What terrible body might support limbs as vile as rorkouns few dare to conjecture, but whatever hidden beings (or more terrible still, single being) manipulate these horrors from the darkness must be unlike anything known to the denizens of Golarion's surface-and must hunger endlessly. Habitat & Society Solitary creatures, rorkoun rarely share hunting grounds. Most, upon encountering another of their kind, attempt to leave the vicinity, avoiding any sort of confrontation and often ridding the area of both creatures. This aversion proves baffling, especially considering the extreme rarity of the beasts, though some suggest that the abominations might prove more receptive toward others of their kind when far below the surface. Those scholars who study rorkouns claim the strange beasts understand both the Common language and that of goblins, though most believe the creatures also have a silent language used among their own kind-despite the creatures' tendency to avoid contact with one another. They frequently live near goblin and mite communities. While these species share an ecological niche as scavengers and occasional hunters, the connection is a bit more complex. Rorkouns never hunt goblins or mites as they find the taste of their flesh repulsive. The creatures do, however, find the savory flavor of greater humanoids succulent; they appreciate the zeal with which those races seek to exterminate goblinkind, as it brings prey close to their lairs for them to feast on. Cowardly and secretive, rorkouns lurk in murky pools or bogs near such creatures' camps, hoping to provoke a fight. Once the battle begins, rorkouns strike, picking off the weakest creatures in the fray before slinking off to digest the meal in the privacy of their dens or some other location where their prey's allies might find it difficult to follow. A rorkoun's benefactors rarely understand the reason for this strange kind of cooperation. While mites tend to fear and flee the aberrations-just as they do most creatures- goblins often concoct more elaborate reasons for why these alien horrors might aid them. Typically, a particularly imaginative goblin convinces his tribe that the rorkoun is in fact a god and that they are its chosen people. All too often this inspires the community to new heights of crazed zealotry and the invention of bizarre forms of sacrifice and adoration. Occasionally rorkouns find their way into the dilapidated or abandoned sewer systems of ruined or declining cities where the shattered remains of such networks have collapsed and formed connections to the Darklands. There rorkouns crawl and swim their way through the slick tunnels and drainpipes, feeding on refuse, vermin, and the occasional sewer dweller or rat catcher. Such unusual beasts rarely prove significant threats, emerging to menace the surface only through what abandoned tunnels and drainage ditches they might happen upon.","<link rel=""stylesheet""href=""PF.css""><div><h2>Rorkoun</h2><h3><i><i>A large amber eye tops a swollen head</i>, <i>surrounded evenly by four mouths loaded with needle-sharp teeth.

The save DC is Constitution-based.","Rot grubs are nauseating parasites that feed on flesh and use corpses as nests in which to grow. While a rot grub can derive nourishment from dead flesh, its true hunger is for the flesh of the living-live flesh greatly accelerates a rot grub's growth to adulthood. A grub with only a corpse to feed on can take weeks to complete its transformation into the short-lived, skittering, yellow-orange arachnid that is its adult form, but a grub that finds living prey gnaws its way through the body and gorges on live flesh, then nests in the resulting corpse and grows to adulthood in a matter of hours. An adult rot grub lives for only a few hours-long enough for it to lay dozens of eggs within the body of its old host before it dies. The new grubs that hatch grow slowly unless a new host wanders by.  Thankfully, rot grub swarms occur only rarely, as they require the infested carcass of a Huge or larger creature and many weeks to build up in the amounts necessary to constitute a swarm. When this occurs-after the grubs have finally skeletonized their host-they erupt and seethe across the ground, a hideous carpet of pale flesh that, unlike smaller groups of rot grubs, actively seeks out living flesh to consume. Once formed, a rot grub swarm is self-sustaining; the vermin quickly devour creatures they slay and move on.  When individual grubs mature in a swarm, they are quickly eaten by those grubs yet to achieve adulthood.  Swarms of rot grubs are single-minded in their purpose, and know only hunger. They are voracious, and never stop moving or pursuing flesh that can be eaten. As long as consumable flesh exists, they replenish their numbers at a speed such that they never need to stop to rest. Swarms of rot grubs have been known to cross vast expanses of land like flesh-eating floods, consuming all living creatures that they happen to encounter. These menaces arise most frequently in warm, moist environs, but prove tenacious and might be found in nearly any unfrozen clime.","<link rel=""stylesheet""href=""PF.css""><div><h2>Rot Grub,  Swarm</h2><h3><i>A nauseating carpet of wriggling white grubs erupts from the corpse's flank, undulating outward in a wave of pallid hunger.</i></h3><br></br></div><div class=""heading""><p class=""alignleft"">Rot Grub Swarm</p><p class=""alignright"">CR 7</p><div style=""clear: both;""></div></div><div><h5><b>XP </b>3,200</h5><h5>N Fine vermin (swarm)</h5><h5><b>Init </b>+2; <b>Senses </b>blindsense 30 ft.; Perception +0</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>DEFENSE</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>AC </b>20, touch 20, flat-footed 18 (+2 Dex, +8 size)</h5><h5><b>hp </b>85 (10d8+40)</h5><h5><b>Fort </b>+11, <b>Ref </b>+5, <b>Will </b>+3</h5><h5><b>Defensive Abilities </b>swarm traits; <b>Immune </b>mind-affecting effects, weapon damage</h5><h5><b>Weaknesses </b>swarm traits</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>OFFENSE</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Spd </b>10 ft.</h5><h5><b>Melee </b>swarm (2d6 plus distraction and infestation)</h5><h5><b>Space </b>10 ft.; <b>Reach </b>0 ft.</h5><h5><b>Special Attacks </b>distraction (DC 19), infestation</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>STATISTICS</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Str</b> 1, <b>Dex</b> 15, <b>Con</b> 18, <b>Int</b> -, <b>Wis</b> 10, <b>Cha</b> 1</h5><h5><b>Base Atk </b>+7; <b>CMB </b>-6; <b>CMD </b>6</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>ECOLOGY</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Environment </b> any</h5><h5><b>Organization </b>solitary</h5><h5><b>Treasure </b>none</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>SPECIAL ABILITIES</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Infestation (Ex)</b> Any living creature that takes damage from a rot grub swarm becomes infested unless he makes a DC 19 Reflex save.

When this occurs-after the grubs have finally skeletonized their host-they erupt and seethe across the ground, a hideous carpet of pale flesh that, unlike smaller groups of rot grubs, actively seeks out living flesh to consume. Once formed, a rot grub swarm is self-sustaining; the vermin quickly devour creatures they slay and move on.</p><p>When individual grubs mature in a swarm, they are quickly eaten by those grubs yet to achieve adulthood.</p><p>Swarms of rot grubs are single-minded in their purpose, and know only hunger. They are voracious, and never stop moving or pursuing flesh that can be eaten. As long as consumable flesh exists, they replenish their numbers at a speed such that they never need to stop to rest. Swarms of rot grubs have been known to cross vast expanses of land like flesh-eating floods, consuming all living creatures that they happen to encounter. These menaces arise most frequently in warm, moist environs, but prove tenacious and might be found in nearly any unfrozen clime.</p></h4></div>",NULL,,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,NULL,NULL,NULL

The race and appearances of these forms are unique to every royal naga. A royal naga cannot transform into a humanoid other than its unique five forms. Unlike polymorph, a royal naga can use its dual gaze while in humanoid form. Dual Gaze (Su) Royal nagas have piercing stares capable of crippling those who meet their gazes. These nagas have two gaze attacks. As a standard action, a royal naga can switch which gaze it is using. Blinding Gaze-Blinded permanently (as per the spell blindness/deafness), 30 feet, Fortitude DC 21 negates. The save DC is Charisma-based.

See Invisibility (Sp) A royal naga can see invisibility, as per the spell, at will. This ability is always in effect. Spells A royal naga casts spells as a 7th-level sorcerer, and can cast spells from the cleric list as well as those normally available to a sorcerer. Cleric spells are considered arcane spells for a royal naga.","Regal and proud creatures, royal nagas haunt lost cities and forgotten kingdoms, guarding ancient treasures for their own inscrutable reasons. Their serpentine bodies are crowned by five stern heads, and their fine scales range through a variety of rich colors, from the lustrous sheen of jade to the rainbow hues of myriad gemstones. The five faces of a royal naga are sharp and fierce, taking on a terrifying countenance when the creature is angered. Bespeaking their innate pride, even vanity, most royal nagas adorn their serpentine hoods or faces with elaborate and valuable piercings, crowns, or other precious adornments. Royal nagas stretch to a length of 14 feet or more, and often weigh more than 750 pounds. Ecology Long-lived creatures, royal nagas frequently seek to make lairs among the shattered remains of cities, castles, and citadels, drawn to the sites for their great historical import and for other, less fathomable reasons. Within their demesnes, they assume the role of protectors of lost treasure and cataloguers of forgotten lore, taking it upon themselves to preserve the relics and history of ancient times. Royal nagas brook no intrusion into their realms, and though the creatures are not violent by nature, they do not hesitate to slay those foolish enough to desecrate the lands they have claimed as their own. Although a royal naga might seek out many forgotten lands within its lifetime, many choose to remain in one location for centuries at a time, plumbing the depths of a city's secrets and protecting it from intrusion. Royal nagas' demeanors match their stately appearance, as they tend to be stern in nature and commanding in speech. Although naturally sociable, they are distrustful of strangers and seem to have great difficulty speaking to other creatures as equals; oftentimes they cannot help but command inferior creatures to do their bidding or speak condescendingly to those whose knowledge of history is inferior to their own. Among those who earn their respect or admiration, royal nagas take great pleasure in discussing the intricacies of history, particularly with regard to their current domains; adventurers who successfully win the trust of these creatures find that they can be invaluable fonts of historical information and advice about how to successfully navigate local dangers. Tales of royal nagas frequently mention the fabulous ancient treasures the creatures are rumored to guard, and feverish dreams of limitless wealth have driven many explorers and adventurers to seek their lairs. Such tales warn against the creatures' ability to assume the shape of men, appearing before interlopers as cloaked and hooded figures who demand to know why the adventurers have trespassed upon their domain, and those fools who rebuff or attack the creatures have had their sight and speech stricken from them. Royal nagas prove exceptional long-lived, with many even claiming to be immortal. Whether these nagas are actually deathless or if this is merely a prideful boast, none can truly say, but it's a well-confirmed fact that royal nagas can live in excess of 1,400 years. Habitat & Society Many scholars of the distant east, from the realms of Casmaron and Vudra where these serpentine lords most commonly lurk, claim that royal nagas were once allies of humanity and advisors to some of the grandest empires the world has ever known. Several epics of these exotic realms speak of enigmatic sages and lordly seers with eyes like those of snakes bearing the wisdom of the gods or realms beneath the mountains and seas. With the fall of many great civilizations of man, it's said that those who were once teachers have becoming caretakers, guarding the secrets they once taught, keeping them safe for the next empire worthy of their counsel. Yet by what standard these ancient nagas hold others worthy, only they know. Within the hidden realms and lost cities they inhabit, royal nagas tend to seek out the most prominent building to serve as their lair. Residing in such magnificent structures as temples or fortresses both stokes their own inflated egos and serves as a strategic position from which they can survey their territories. If no such building exists or remains intact, they settle for the most grandiose natural feature of the surrounding landscape, be it atop the crest of a hill or beneath the roots of an enormous tree. The interiors of such lairs often bear little evidence of habitation, the only sign of the naga's presence being the snake-like trails left in the dust and the raspy sound of their slithering approach. Much to their chagrin, royal nagas often find that they are not the only creatures who prowl the ruins of ancient civilizations. The nagas cannot abide the presence of others in their domains, particularly those who would defile the pristine architecture or who seek to attain forbidden lore for destructive purposes; consequently, they frequently clash against monstrous interlopers, such as tribes of feral humanoids, horrors crawled from the depths of the Darklands, powerful fiends, and worse. If they cannot kill or drive away such monsters entirely, royal nagas claim a portion of the city for themselves and defend it against all intruders. Occasionally, a royal naga will form alliances with its neighbors, using them to drive away explorers and other intruders in exchange for a portion of the treasure hoard it accumulates. Royal nagas rarely seek out other nagas to associate with, perceiving most as being beneath them. This doesn't prevent such creatures from having dealings, though, should a royal naga's ego be suitably indulged. Such is not uncommon when nagas of disparate types do meet, though, as both dark and guardian nagas hold great respect for their multi-headed kindred, regarding them with an almost holy esteem. Spirit nagas, on the other hand, vehemently despise royal nagas, and both breeds attempt to kill members of the other type on sight.","<link rel=""stylesheet""href=""PF.css""><div><h2>Naga, Royal </h2><h3><i>Lifting itself upright, this golden-scaled snake possesses five vaguely human-looking heads.

Great cities raised by these creatures darken the deep ocean trenches, and many are the near-coastal fortresses where they launch endless raids against their air-breathing enemies who dwell in close proximity to the shore. Warlike and proud, the sahuagin rarely ally with others, and view most other aquatic races such as the aboleths, the merfolk, and their ilk as competitors. The only creatures they seem to respect and adore apart from their own kind are sharks, for in these relentless predators the sahuagin see much of themselves. A sahuagin stands 7 feet tall and weighs about 250 pounds.  Sahuagin are prone to beneficial mutations, and when a mutant is born it almost always rises to the society's nobility or rulership. The most common sahuagin mutation is an extra pair of arms (granting two additional claw attacks or the opportunity to wield more weapons).

At the beginning of each day, it determines an individual to serve as its target and which one of its three vengeances it may make use of that day. It may not change this target or ability until the next day. The target may be any specific creature the salikotal knows of, even if it has not seen its target before. This target is treated as being known to a salikotal for the purposes of using its locate creature ability, even if the devil has never seen its victim before. Sneak Attack (Ex) Anytime a salikotal's opponent is denied his Dexterity bonus to AC, or if a salikotal flanks his opponent, he deals an extra 3d6 points of damage. This ability is just like the rogue's sneak attack and subject to the same limitations. Suicide (Su) As a standard action, a salikotal may target itself with a coup de grace attack. If the salikotal reduces itself to fewer than 0 hit points-or fails to do so but still fails the associated Fortitude save (DC = 10 + damage dealt)-the salikotal erupts in a burst of destructive energy. Any creature within 15 feet of a salikotal that commits suicide is damaged by a blast of metal shards and needle-like scales, taking 6d6 points of damage (DC 17, save for half ). The save DC is Constitution-based. Upon using this ability, a salikotal is permanently destroyed. This effect only takes place if a salikotal willingly ends its own life, not if it is killed by outside effects. Vengeance (Su) While seeking a victim a salikotal prepares itself daily, honing its will to effectively slaughter its intended quarry. On a given day, chosen as part of its contract killer ability, a salikotal may gain the benefit of any one of the following powers, either the one it feels will most aid it or whichever one its summoner requests. Only one of these abilities is active on a given day, and it only comes into effect when a salikotal kills its intended target with a coup de grace. These executions only function on living creatures. Fideicide: The victim's soul is immediately shunted to a infernal prison on Erebus, the third layer of Hell. The soul can be returned to life, but upon casting the spell, the spellcaster attempting the resurrection takes an amount of fire damage equal to 1d6 x the victim's number of Hit Dice, and must make an immediate concentration check (DC 10 + damage delt + spell level) or lose the spell. Necrocide: After 1d4 rounds, the victim's body animates as a zombie under the salikotal's control. The devil may permanently grant control of the zombie to any sentient creature as a free action. Omnicide: The victim's body is utterly destroyed, disintegrating without a trace. Its clothing and possessions remain unharmed. Only spells that do not require a portion of the corpse may return the victim to life.","Prince-killers and assassins of souls, salikotals serve as the bloody chisels by which the lords of Hell subtly shape the mortal world to their whims. Soaring through the night on silent wings, these murderous devils care nothing for life or reason, knowing only a single, murderous goal. Cloaked by shadow and silence, few ever glimpse the sharp features of a salikotal, for Hell's death-dealers reveal themselves only amid the haze of fading life. Lean, deft hunters, salikotals move like terrible predatory birds, each taloned step measured, cautious, and full of deadly intent. Protected by an armor of sharp, thin scales, these agile devils universally stand 5 feet, 4 inches tall, and weigh 85 pounds, their barbed frames supporting the breadth of their 8-foot-wide, bat-like wings. They have full control over their slender tails, nimbly manipulating objects and even wielding deadly, Hell-forged blades in these dexterous, prehensile appendages. Ecology Salikotals rise from the tenebrous reaches of Erebus's vaulted heights. Unblinking and endlessly patient, salikotals haunt the claustrophobic upper realms of the lightless labyrinth, stealthy and watchful but caring little for the doings of intruders or their lesser kin. Only the summons of conjurers or the diabolical elite rouse them from their eerie aerial stalkings, drawing them forth from the shadows for a chance to hone their death-dealing expertise in the name of Hell. Naturally silent, salikotals never vocalize even the slightest sound, relying on their innate telepathic abilities for communication. Even when using such mental interaction, though, the devils prove terse and resistant to conversation. For most summoners, a salikotal's only communication is a slow nod acknowledging its orders, and a nod in answer to the question of its murderous success. Habitat & Society Salikotals have little to do with others of their kind, be they other salikotals or other lesser devils in general. Emotionless and rigid even beyond the typical disciplines of Hell, these assassins realize they exist for but a single reason: to sow death. Their cold precision only wavers when they discuss payment for their most notorious murderous methods, wherein they demand specific types of gemstones in compensation for their grisly work. Few non-devils dare to suppose why salikotals request such precise payments, refusing to work for any other recompense, but among the damned spread rumors of vast vaults filled with glistening jewels, each a fabulous treasure and a representation of a life cut short by the blades of Hell. Summoning Salikotals As in all things, salikotals prove emotionless when it comes to being summoned. They have little reason to purposefully resist or accept a diabolist's call, unless ordered to do so by their infernal masters. Once a salikotal is summoned, though, only murder interests it. Any Charisma check made as part of the spell planar binding to convince a salikotal to undertake a mission other than assassination takes a -2 penalty. Once a salikotal has agreed to perform a murder for its summoner, it explains the signature vengeances its kind can inflict upon a victim and offers to exact one upon its summoner's victim for an associated price. The devil requests 1,000 gp for every Hit Die its target possesses (intrinsically gauging its victim's prowess), to be paid entirely in one of three types of gemstones: ruby for fideicide, onyx for necrocide, and jacyinth for omnicide. Salikotals prove exceedingly particular in these payments, and if a summoner cannot pay the price in the type of gem requested, the devil refuses to exact one of its vengeances. If the summoner tries to force a salikotal to use one of its vengeances, the devil takes offense and all of the summoner's Charisma-related interactions with it in the future take a -2 penalty.","<link rel=""stylesheet""href=""PF.css""><div><h2>Devil, Salikotal</h2><h3><i>On lean limbs the color of spilt blood creeps a being of sinister grace.

Sea hags prefer to dwell relatively close to shore where fishermen and trading vessels are more commonly encountered.  Most choose to live far from urban areas so that their acts don't draw as much attention from would-be enemies, but it's not uncommon for a particularly brave or eager sea hag to settle in a city harbor or in the mouth of a deep river.  Sea hags form covens similar to other hags, but their aquatic nature generally keeps them from forming mixed covens.  In the case of a shorelinedwelling green hag (often a green hag who dwells in a saltmarsh or other coastal swampland), a coven often consists of two sea hags who look to the green hag as their mother and leader.

Although it cannot fly, a falling shadowgarm always descends as if under the effects of a feather fall spell, and thus never takes falling damage. Light Fixation (Su) Although a shadowgarm is not particularly harmed by bright light, it prefers dim lighting. Magical light, on the other hand, causes a shadowgarm to grow slow and lethargic. Whenever a shadowgarm is within an area of bright light that is magically created, it is staggered. Shadow Blend (Su) In conditions of dim light, a shadowgarm's outline wavers and blends with the surrounding shadows, granting it concealment (20% miss chance) even if its opponents are capable of seeing clearly in dim light. Shadow Slime (Su) A shadowgarm is coated with a thin layer of oily black slime. Whenever it strikes a foe, it transfers a swath of this cold black slime onto the creature struck. This slime causes a growing numbness and lethargy in the bodies of those it coats. Each time a creature takes damage from a shadowgarm's claws, the creature struck must make a DC 13 Fortitude save or take a cumulative -2 penalty to its Dexterity score. A creature whose total Dexterity penalty equals its Dexterity score is paralyzed and blinded as long as the penalty remains in effect. All accrued Dexterity penalties fade an hour after the last time the victim was affected by shadow slime, but any new shadow slime resets the recovery period. Exposure to bright light of any sort causes the Dexterity penalty to lessen by 2 points per round until all of the shadow slime is effectively ""burned away"" by the light. A shadowgarm is immune to the effects of its shadow slime and the shadow slime of other shadowgarms. The save DC is Constitution-based.","Shadowgarms are strange monsters from the Plane of Shadow, where they function as lowly predators and pests somewhat akin to the Material Plane's coyotes, leopards, and similar hunting mammals. Yet to a creature unfamiliar with the workings of the Plane of Shadow, the shadowgarm is a hideous and frightening beast. Generally lairing in ruined sections of towns or dead-end alleys clogged with refuse during the day, they come out at night to prey upon creatures that stray too far from the safety of light. These aberrant predators ""leak"" into the Material Plane anywhere the Plane of Shadow's influence is strong. Small groups of shadowgarms are occasionally seen lurking in old graveyards where undead (particularly shadows) are known to reside, and anywhere that has strong traditions of shadow magic tends to have a healthy population of shadowgarms lurking in out-of-the-way areas as well. The typical shadowgarm measures about 4-1/2 feet long and weighs approximately 90 pounds, their bodies being strangely light, composed of a spongy dark matter and seemingly wisps of shadow itself. Some, however, grow to be much larger, though shadowgarms of all sizes prove especially adept at blending in among the shadows and detritus of their hunting grounds or crawling into crevices it seems creatures of their size would not be able to squeeze. Ecology Strange beings with a little-understood physiology, shadowgarms prove endlessly hungry, taking sustenance from shadow as if it were water and drawing nutrition from the flesh of other creatures as their only source of food. Shadowgarms can eat and digest any sort of animal matter, from flesh to bone, converting them into little more than smoke and shadow. A creature left to a shadowgarm to feed upon leaves behind nothing but trappings of metal and similarly solid accessories. A shadowgarm's physical form seems strangely fluid, proving slightly malleable and generalized. No two shadowgarms appear exactly alike, and even individuals of the race seem to gradually change, all the faster in areas of deep shadows. Regardless of their endless, fluid alterations, they retain three primary clawed appendages, which serve them in consuming meals and fighting. Their number of feelers or tentacle-like legs, however, is constantly in flux, numbering but two or three one moment and then multiplying to dozens the next. Shadowgarms do not have a mouth and hardly have heads to speak off-possessing only slight knobby protuberances that seem to have little role in guiding their motions. When ingesting matter, they slowly dissolve their meals, their bodies breaking down any organic substance they choose by resting upon their meal for a matter of moments. The entire process might be likened to a body-wide ingestion process similar to that of a fly, as matter is dissolved and subsumed by the shadowy hunter's bulk. Once every several months, the urge to mate descends upon shadowgarms like a mass racial insanity. At this time, their natural aversion to their own kind is overwhelmed by a need to procreate. Shadowgarms are hemaphroditic, but cannot fertilize themselves- when a shadowgarm gathering begins, these creatures congregate in groups of up to a dozen, remaining in close proximity to each other for days at a time. The cycle that drives shadowgarm gatherings is nothing connected to the Material Plane-most scholars have been unable to determine what pattern the timing follows, if indeed there is a pattern at all. Habitat & Society Although shadowgarms are quite active at all times on the Plane of Shadow, the realities of the Material Plane force them into the niche of nocturnal predator. Yet despite their hatred of light, they seem to need it in some strange way. Observers have noted that the creatures prefer to stand in actual shadows, rather than just in darkness, and seem to savor the ever-changing nature of the shadows themselves. It may be that shadowgarms abhor total darkness as much as light, though neither bright light nor utter darkness causes them physical harm. Most shadowgarms' hunts take place under the light of the full moon, or in the shadowy hours of dusk or dawn. In cities where shadowgarms are common, they naturally gravitate to sewers or narrow alleys. This allows them the easiest way to quickly strike at unwary victims from above or below. They do not build any sort of true nest or lair, preferring to remain constantly afoot in search of new prey. As shadowgarms have no fear of falling, they often clamber up to corners and niches at the tops of tunnels or just under rooftop overhangs, both to avoid any bright light that might be shining down from above and to lie in wait to ambush unsuspecting prey that walks underneath. This leads to the discovery of shadowgarms in truly unexpected and unnerving places, like in bell towers, within attics and crawl spaces, and even hidden amid cracks and loose shingles in old roofing. More than one child's tale of boogiemen or strange shapes lurking outside their windows might actually be attributed to the daring nocturnal wanderings of shadowgarms. Shadowgarms are incredibly territorial, and usually do not nest together except during their mating gathering. Shadowgarms immediately confront one another upon meeting. Pickpockets and other street urchins often share wild tales of shadowgarms battling fiercely in the alleyways and nighted dens, fighting with raw savagery instead of their more customary stealth. Some canny streetfolk use this territorial nature to trick competing shadowgarms into fighting each other, giving wanderers out after dark enough time to move through territories infested by these lurking hunters without being attacked. Of course, this tactic doesn't work well in areas where large numbers of shadowgarms are known to skulk, as directing one's attention to avoid a single hunter might prevent a traveler from noticing other predators lying in wait in the shadows. On rare occasions, a shadowgarm might take to the seas, stealing aboard a ship at dock and hiding in the hold. Once at sea, such hunters emerge nightly to prey upon the ship's crew. Since a shadowgarm melts away into shadow and fog when it dies, leaving no evidence of a corpse behind, this might be one explanation for mysteriously derelict ships found adrift on the waves with nothing living on board.","<link rel=""stylesheet""href=""PF.css""><div><h2>Shadowgarm</h2><h3><i>This amorphous creature loosely resembles a cross between a large snake and an insect.

Some canny streetfolk use this territorial nature to trick competing shadowgarms into fighting each other, giving wanderers out after dark enough time to move through territories infested by these lurking hunters without being attacked.</p><p>Of course, this tactic doesn't work well in areas where large numbers of shadowgarms are known to skulk, as directing one's attention to avoid a single hunter might prevent a traveler from noticing other predators lying in wait in the shadows.</p><p>On rare occasions, a shadowgarm might take to the seas, stealing aboard a ship at dock and hiding in the hold. Once at sea, such hunters emerge nightly to prey upon the ship's crew. Since a shadowgarm melts away into shadow and fog when it dies, leaving no evidence of a corpse behind, this might be one explanation for mysteriously derelict ships found adrift on the waves with nothing living on board.</p></h4></div>",NULL,,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,,,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,NULL,NULL,NULL

Primitive and territorial, they resent being summoned or doing the bidding of mortals, and much prefer to spend their time on the Plane of Air, swooping and racing through the endless skies. Although all air elementals of a similar size have identical statistics, the exact appearance of an air elemental can vary wildly between individuals. One might be an animated vortex of wind and smoke, while another might be a smoky bird-like creature with glowing eyes and wind for wings. An air elemental prefers to attack flying or otherwise airbone targets, not only because its mastery over flight gives it a slight advantage, but also because it detests the thought of having to touch the ground. An air elemental can move underwater, and although it is an elemental and thus runs no risk of drowning, it has no ranks in Swim and loses much of its speed and mobility when underwater.

They do not gain access to domains or other cleric abilities.  Slaying Arrow (Su) A solar's bow needs no ammunition, and automatically creates a slaying arrow of the solar's choice when drawn.","Solars are the greatest type of angel, usually serving at the right hand of a deity or championing a cause that benefits an entire world or plane. A typical solar looks roughly human, though some physically resemble other humanoid races and a rare few have even more unusual forms. A solar stands about 9 feet tall and weighs about 500 pounds, with a strong, commanding voice that is impossible to ignore.  Most have silvery or golden skin.  Blessed with an array of magical powers and the spellcasting abilities of the most powerful clerics, solars are powerful opponents capable of single-handedly slaying mighty evils. They are the greatest trackers among the celestials, the most masterful of which are said to be able to track the days-old wake of a pit fiend flying through the Astral Plane. Some take on the mantle of monster-slayers and hunt powerful fiends and undead such as devourers, night hags, night shades, and pit fiends, even making forays into the evil planes and the Negative Energy Plane to destroy these creatures at their source before they can bring harm to mortals. A few very old solars have succeeded at this task and bear slayer-names of dread creatures that are now extinct by the solar's hand.  Solars accept roles as guardians, usually of fundamental supernatural concepts, or objects or creatures of great importance. On one world, a group of solars patrols the energy conduits of the sun, alert for any attempts by evil races such as drow to snuff out the light and bring eternal darkness. On another, seven solars stand watch over seven mystical chains keeping evil gods bound within a prison demiplane. On yet another, a solar with a flaming sword stands watch over the original mortal paradise so that no creature may enter.  In worlds where the gods cannot take physical form, they send solars to be their prophets and gurus (often pretending to be mortals), laying the foundation for cults that grow to become great religions. Likewise, in worlds oppressed by evil, solars are the secret priests who bring hope to the downtrodden, or in some cases allow themselves to be martyred so that their holy essence can explode outward to land and grow in the hearts of great heroes-to-be.  Though they are not gods, the solars' power approaches that of demigods, and they often have an advisory role for younger or weaker deities. In some polytheistic faiths, mortals worship one or more solars as aspects or near-equal servants of the true deities-never without the deity's approval-or consider notable solars to be offspring, consorts, lovers, or spouses of true deities (which they may be, depending on the deity).  Unlike other angels, most solars are created from an amalgam of good souls and raw divine energy to directly serve the gods, but an increasing number of these powerful angels have been ""promoted"" to their existence as solars from lesser creatures like planetars or devas. A few rare and powerful good souls ascend directly to the status of solar. The oldest solars predate mortality and are among the gods' first creations. These strange solars are paragons of their kind and have little direct interaction with mortals, focusing on the protection or destruction of abstract concepts such as gravity, dark matter, entropy, and primordial evil.  Solars who spend a long time in the Material Plane, especially those in the guise of mortals, are sometimes the source of half-celestial or aasimar bloodlines in mortal families, due either to romantic dalliances or simply the mortals' proximity to celestial energy. Actual offspring are rare, and when they occur, it is always a mortal mother that bears the child- while solars can appear as either sex, the gods have not granted them the capacity for pregnancy or motherhood. Indeed, this fundamental truth is often what drives a solar to seek out a mortal lover. Since begetting a child upon a mortal is generally frowned upon by other solars, a solar father rarely interacts directly with the fate of his lover or child, so as to avoid bringing shame upon himself or his responsibilities.  Yet such solars still watch over their progeny from afar, and in times of peril, they might even be moved to intercede to aid one of their endangered children, albiet in subtle and mysterious ways.  All angels respect the power and wisdom of solars, and though these mightiest of angels usually work alone, they sometimes command multiple armies led by planetars, acting as great field marshals for massive incursions against the legions of Hell or the hordes of the Abyss.","<link rel=""stylesheet""href=""PF.css""><div><h2>Angel, Solar</h2><h3><i>This towering humanoid creature has shining topaz eyes, metallic skin, and three pairs of white wings.</i></h3><br></br></div><div class=""heading""><p class=""alignleft"">Solar</p><p class=""alignright"">CR 23</p><div style=""clear: both;""></div></div><div><h5><b>XP </b>819,200</h5><h5>NG Large outsider (angel, extraplanar, good)</h5><h5><b>Init </b>+9; <b>Senses </b>darkvision 60 ft., low-light vision, detect evil,  detect snares and pits, true seeing; Perception +33</h5><h5><b>Aura </b>protective aura</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>DEFENSE</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>AC </b>44, touch 11, flat-footed 42 (+14 armor, +1 Dex, +1 dodge, +19 natural, -1 size +4 deflection vs. evil)</h5><h5><b>hp </b>363 (22d10+242)</h5><h5><b>Fort </b>+25, <b>Ref </b>+14, <b>Will </b>+23; +4 vs. poison, +4 resistance vs. evil</h5><h5><b>DR </b>15/epic and evil; <b>Immune </b>acid, cold, petrification; <b>Resist </b>electricity 10, fire 10; <b>SR </b>34</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>OFFENSE</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Spd </b>50 ft., fly 150 ft.

A typical solar looks roughly human, though some physically resemble other humanoid races and a rare few have even more unusual forms. A solar stands about 9 feet tall and weighs about 500 pounds, with a strong, commanding voice that is impossible to ignore.</p><p>Most have silvery or golden skin.</p><p>Blessed with an array of magical powers and the spellcasting abilities of the most powerful clerics, solars are powerful opponents capable of single-handedly slaying mighty evils. They are the greatest trackers among the celestials, the most masterful of which are said to be able to track the days-old wake of a pit fiend flying through the Astral Plane. Some take on the mantle of monster-slayers and hunt powerful fiends and undead such as devourers, night hags, night shades, and pit fiends, even making forays into the evil planes and the Negative Energy Plane to destroy these creatures at their source before they can bring harm to mortals. A few very old solars have succeeded at this task and bear slayer-names of dread creatures that are now extinct by the solar's hand.</p><p>Solars accept roles as guardians, usually of fundamental supernatural concepts, or objects or creatures of great importance. On one world, a group of solars patrols the energy conduits of the sun, alert for any attempts by evil races such as drow to snuff out the light and bring eternal darkness. On another, seven solars stand watch over seven mystical chains keeping evil gods bound within a prison demiplane. On yet another, a solar with a flaming sword stands watch over the original mortal paradise so that no creature may enter.</p><p>In worlds where the gods cannot take physical form, they send solars to be their prophets and gurus (often pretending to be mortals), laying the foundation for cults that grow to become great religions. Likewise, in worlds oppressed by evil, solars are the secret priests who bring hope to the downtrodden, or in some cases allow themselves to be martyred so that their holy essence can explode outward to land and grow in the hearts of great heroes-to-be.</p><p>Though they are not gods, the solars' power approaches that of demigods, and they often have an advisory role for younger or weaker deities. In some polytheistic faiths, mortals worship one or more solars as aspects or near-equal servants of the true deities-never without the deity's approval-or consider notable solars to be offspring, consorts, lovers, or spouses of true deities (which they may be, depending on the deity).</p><p>Unlike other angels, most solars are created from an amalgam of good souls and raw divine energy to directly serve the gods, but an increasing number of these powerful angels have been ""promoted"" to their existence as solars from lesser creatures like planetars or devas. A few rare and powerful good souls ascend directly to the status of solar. The oldest solars predate mortality and are among the gods' first creations. These strange solars are paragons of their kind and have little direct interaction with mortals, focusing on the protection or destruction of abstract concepts such as gravity, dark matter, entropy, and primordial evil.</p><p>Solars who spend a long time in the Material Plane, especially those in the guise of mortals, are sometimes the source of half-celestial or aasimar bloodlines in mortal families, due either to romantic dalliances or simply the mortals' proximity to celestial energy. Actual offspring are rare, and when they occur, it is always a mortal mother that bears the child- while solars can appear as either sex, the gods have not granted them the capacity for pregnancy or motherhood. Indeed, this fundamental truth is often what drives a solar to seek out a mortal lover. Since begetting a child upon a mortal is generally frowned upon by other solars, a solar father rarely interacts directly with the fate of his lover or child, so as to avoid bringing shame upon himself or his responsibilities.</p><p>Yet such solars still watch over their progeny from afar, and in times of peril, they might even be moved to intercede to aid one of their endangered children, albiet in subtle and mysterious ways.</p><p>All angels respect the power and wisdom of solars, and though these mightiest of angels usually work alone, they sometimes command multiple armies led by planetars, acting as great field marshals for massive incursions against the legions of Hell or the hordes of the Abyss.</p></h4></div>",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,NULL,NULL,NULL

Sometimes called the ""sown men,"" spartoi hold a fundamental connection to the near-mythical magical items known as a spartoi seeds, teeth that when planted in the earth summon forth these undead, fully armed and ready for command. Although ancient versions of these items prove especially rare, the well-known nature of their myth has led to dozens of modern versions being created and, with them, a rise in the appearance of spartoi. A typical spartolos stands about 5-1/2 to 6-1/2 feet tall, weighing approximately 70 pounds with its full compliment of equipment. Ecology As undead beings, spartoi have no need for food or shelter and have little effect on their environments. Yet despite being obedient undead, all spartoi seem to favor resting as disjoined piles of bones rather than standing corpses. Although the undead know no sensations of exertion, spartoi left to their own devices or without commands to do otherwise collapse into scattered remains. Whether such is a matter of tactics and subterfuge or fulfills some other need, the animate corpses give no hint. Spartoi detect as being of evil alignment merely because the powers animating them prove fundamentally foul. In some cases, spartoi raised from the corpses of particularly goodly or otherwise forceful individuals might retain the alignment they possessed in life. Habitat & Society The spartoi are undead skeletons-albeit much more powerful than other versions-designed for war. They have no wants or desires other than to serve their masters, and they carry no fear. Though they have some defense against channeled energy, the spartoi are just as susceptible to divine spellcasters as any other undead. All spartoi spring into being with weaponry, typically a spear, buckler, and breastplate, though some rare individuals have been known to arise with more unusual armaments. In such cases, short swords, punching daggers, glaives, and great clubs prove most common. Only the rarest of spartoi have been known to arise brandishing ranged weapons, their undead forms seeming to lack the coordination for such arms. In any case, spartoi weaponry and armor typically bear the markings of ancient cultures, often appearing to be from lands near where the undead (or its spartoi seeds) were created. Despite their skill and cooperation in battle, spartoi have little interest in one another. Even spartoi apparently risen from rival nations or cultures seem to forget all past rivalries in death. The mind of a spartolos is a mind possessed by a will to do battle and a skill or instinct seemingly inherent in the bones of great warriors, actual vestiges of personality lingering on only in the rarest cases. Even those spartoi retaining some hint of their former personalities seem interested only in completing their master's will and swiftly returning to their rightful place in death. Such causes many concerned with the necromantic arts to ponder over whether their magic draws forth an actual spirit to its bones, or merely causes a corpse to act with a hint of the personality that was bound to it in life. Creating a Spartolos A spartolos might be created in a number of ways. Most simply, a create undead spell cast by a magic-user of caster level 16 or greater can infuse a dead body with a heroic spirit, resurrecting it as a spartolos. Alternatively, one might seek out rare items known as spartoi seeds. Although relatively rare, the oldest seeds might summon forth the corpses of legendary heroes rather than typical spartoi. These slain champions, while possessing the same statistics as normal spartoi in death, possess the ability to speak and often bear great insight into the ways of battle or memories from their lives. Mythic Seeds Numerous myths across Golarion tell of legendary, magical fangs that summon forth the spirits or corpses of powerful warriors. The most pervasive of these tales comes from the ancient myth of the Jiskan hero Strada, though countless variations exist in dozen of cultures across Avistan. Legends tell of the mythic hero Strada tasked by the devil Alichino with the impossible charge of besieging an unconquerable city. Seeking out the oracle of Gorum, god of battle, the hero was gifted the thousand fangs of the dragon Kathalphas, who was said to have grown an additional tooth with every champion she had slain. Told to sow these fangs into the dust surrounding the city, the hero praised Gorum and departed graciously. Upon reaching the city, he did as the priest had advised, and to his astonishment, the skeletons of the dragon's thousand victims leapt from the ground, clad in all the finery of epic warriors, and arrayed to do battle in Strada's name. The unconquerable city fell in an hour, much to the fury of capering Alichino, and for 90 splendorous years Strada ruled as king with an army of the world's greatest warriors ever guarding his palace gates.

They do not possess any of the abilities they had in life.  </h5><h5><b>Resurrection Vulnerability (Su)</b> A raise dead or similar spell cast on a spectre destroys it (Will negates). Using the spell in this way does not require a material component.</h5><h5><b>  Sunlight Powerlessness (Ex)</b> Spectres are powerless in natural sunlight (not merely a daylight spell) and flee from it. A spectre caught in sunlight cannot attack and is staggered.  </h5><h5><b>Unnatural Aura (Su)</b> Animals, whether wild or domesticated, can sense the unnatural presence of a spectre at a distance of 30 feet. They do not willingly approach nearer than that and panic if forced to do so unless a master succeeds at a DC 25 Handle Animal, Ride, or wild empathy check. A panicked animal remains so as long as it is within 30 feet of the spectre.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p>Spectres are evil undead that hate sunlight and living things. Most are the remnants of murdered or evil humans, their anger preventing them from entering the afterlife.</p><p>Like ghosts, spectres haunt the places of their deaths, and seek to draw others into the lonely abyss of undeath.</p><p>A spectre looks much as it did in life and can be easily recognized by those who knew the individual or have seen the individual's face in paintings or drawings. Spectres retain a strong sense of identity, and even ancient, insane spectres generally remain coherent. Evil historians and necromancers often try to ally with spectres for the knowledge they held in life and retain in undeath.</p></h4></div>",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,,,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL

An attached stirge is effectively grappling its prey. The stirge loses its Dexterity bonus to AC and has an AC of 12, but holds on with great tenacity and inserts its proboscis into the grappled target's flesh. A stirge has a +8 racial bonus to maintain its grapple on a foe once it is attached. An attached stirge can be struck with a weapon or grappled itself-if its prey manages to win a grapple check or Escape Artist check against it, the stirge is removed.  Blood Drain (Ex) A stirge drains blood at the end of its turn if it is attached to a foe, inflicting 1 point of Constitution damage. Once a stirge has dealt 4 points of Constitution damage, it detaches and flies off to digest the meal. If its victim dies before the stirge's appetite has been sated, the stirge detaches and seeks a new target.  Diseased (Ex) Due to the stagnant swamps in which they live and their contact with the blood of numerous creatures, stirges are harbingers of disease. Any creature subjected to a stirge's blood drain attack has a 10% chance of being exposed to filth fever, blinding sickness, or a similar disease (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 557). Once this check is made, the victim can no longer be infected by this particular stirge, though attacks by different stirges are resolved normally and may result in multiple illnesses.","Stirges are vicious, blood-drinking swamp pests that prey on wild animals, livestock, and unwary travelers. While weak individually, swarms of the creatures are capable of draining a man dry in minutes, leaving only a desiccated husk in their wake.  Closer to mammals than insects, stirges carry their bodies through the air on four fleshy wings, searching out warm-blooded prey. They are fond of hiding near watering holes and waiting for travelers to drop their guard, then swooping out to attach and drink their fill by thrusting their long feeding tubes into unprotected veins.

An attached stirge is effectively grappling its prey. The stirge loses its Dexterity bonus to AC and has an AC of 12, but holds on with great tenacity and inserts its proboscis into the grappled target's flesh. A stirge has a +8 racial bonus to maintain its grapple on a foe once it is attached. An attached stirge can be struck with a weapon or grappled itself-if its prey manages to win a grapple check or Escape Artist check against it, the stirge is removed.</h5><h5><b>  Blood Drain (Ex)</b> A stirge drains blood at the end of its turn if it is attached to a foe, inflicting 1 point of Constitution damage. Once a stirge has dealt 4 points of Constitution damage, it detaches and flies off to digest the meal. If its victim dies before the stirge's appetite has been sated, the stirge detaches and seeks a new target.</h5><h5><b>  Diseased (Ex)</b> Due to the stagnant swamps in which they live and their contact with the blood of numerous creatures, stirges are harbingers of disease. Any creature subjected to a stirge's blood drain attack has a 10% chance of being exposed to filth fever, blinding sickness, or a similar disease (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 557). Once this check is made, the victim can no longer be infected by this particular stirge, though attacks by different stirges are resolved normally and may result in multiple illnesses.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p>Stirges are vicious, blood-drinking swamp pests that prey on wild animals, livestock, and unwary travelers. While weak individually, swarms of the creatures are capable of draining a man dry in minutes, leaving only a desiccated husk in their wake.</p><p>Closer to mammals than insects, stirges carry their bodies through the air on four fleshy wings, searching out warm-blooded prey. They are fond of hiding near watering holes and waiting for travelers to drop their guard, then swooping out to attach and drink their fill by thrusting their long feeding tubes into unprotected veins.

Nocturnal (Ex) Strix gain a +2 racial bonus on Perception and Stealth checks at night.,"Devil's Perch, an infamous reach of Avistan's southwestern coast, has long captured the imaginations of the Chelish people. For untold centuries, gruesome deaths and diabolical shadows have haunted the region's spires, while local folklore weaves tales of winged devils. There strange rock spurs and unnaturally deep abysses make the heights deadly and nearly impossible to reach by land, and those who manage to survive the pitiless environment swiftly discover that the land's inhabitants, the dark-winged strix, do not welcome trespassers. Winged humanoids, the strix fiercely defend both their land and their air, claiming dominion over all reaches within sight of Ciricskree, the Screeching Spire. Deadly but wise, savage yet content with their realm, the strix would prefer to live quietly amid the towers of Devil's Perch, yet time and tradition have taught them the wingless peoples of the shores and lowlands cannot be trusted, and that only fear and bloodshed will protect their ancient lands. The common strix stands just over 6 feet tall, with males and females being roughly the same size. Sharply pointed ears, pupilless eyes, and slitted nostrils distinguish the race, though their 12-foot wingspans prove most distinctive. An adult strix weighs around 170 pounds. Most strix live to be about 40 years old, with the eldest reaching ages of up to 60. Strix speak their own language, a strange pidgin of Azlanti and Infernal understandable only by those who speak both languages or Strix. Ecology A mysterious, secretive race of winged humanoids, the isolationist strix are set apart from their human neighbors by several subtle differences. The eyes of strix prove particularly interesting, as they are both highly reflective-leading many tales to claim the natives of Devil's Perch possess glowing eyes-and fixed within their owners' heads, forcing strix to rotate their necks to adjust their field of vision. This causes most strix to appear either stiff and somber or jerky and skittish in their rare dealings with other creatures. Strix also possess slightly clawed hands and feet, which aid them in gripping perches but are too delicate to be used as weapons. Habitat & Society The only known strix in Avistan occupy a single group of tall, rocky spires in western Cheliax, communally known as Devil's Perch. From their largest settlement atop the spire of Ciricskree, they hunt the surrounding land by night and guard their territories against the slightest incursion, especially those made by humans. Strix have learned to hate humans, and teach their young from an early age to fear and mistrust them above all other races. Although the source of this hatred proves unclear to all but the strix, it most likely comes from centuries of bloody invasions into their lands, disastrous first encounters, or an even older grudge. Strix culture is tightly knit, as it must be in a society numbering less than a thousand members. Children are cherished and deaths are serious and ceremonious occasions. Murder is unknown among the strix, except when those of their kind are slain by outsiders. The strix take a vicious eye for an eye stance when it comes to retaliation. They also realize that they are small compared to the human nation that-as they see it-besieges them, and view the death of one of their number as proportionally equaling dozens, even hundreds, of outsiders. Suspecting that the cultures of land dwellers prove as tightly knit as their own, the strix might strike against and destroy an entire ship or caravan that comes near their land, avenging themselves against victims who have done no wrong. Their ways are often bloody, but they are not merciless, and what they do, they do only to survive. Lost Origins of the Strix Few who know of the strix believe them to be natives of Avistan's shores. Although such tales are never told to outsiders, even the legends held by the strix of Devil Perch cast doubt on their origins. Rather, ancient tales passed down through their oral tradition tell of a green storm that carried the vicious and undeserving far from their homes, where they and their children would be punished until the sun ceased to rise in the sky. Then came the time when the sun did cease to rise, and the ancestors of the strix were freed from their torment. Lost and alone in a world of darkness, they hunted like beasts for untold years until those few of their race's survivors came to a fortress of stone, where the fish of the sea were plentiful and the terrors of the earth could not reach. There they made their home, and there they have stayed-the inheritors of a forgotten exile-for thousands of years. Aside from these legends, little remains among the strix connecting them to a greater past, though all among those of Devil's Perch harbor the belief that their people are cursed and bear the shame of misdeeds of which none among them know the truth. The great library of Iadara in Kyonin, however, bears faded and ancient scrolls of a strange leather. Said to have been saved from before the Age of Darkness, these man-sized rolls show both black and gray figures bearing great wings and mysterious masks sitting among the men of Azlant and the elves of the lost elven fortress of Adarshavir. Only a handful of elven scholars have made the supposition that the tales of winged devils in western Cheliax and this ancient scrollwork might bear some connection. Strix as Characters Strix are defined by their class levels-they do not possess racial Hit Dice. All strix have the following racial traits. +2 Dexterity, -2 Charisma: Strix are swift and elusive, but their fearsome appearances and insular nature make them difficult to interact with. Normal Speed: Strix have a base speed of 30 feet. Flight: Strix have a fly speed of 60 feet with average maneuverability.

While holding or otherwise in contact with a gemstone of at least the size of a human eye, a stygira can see through the gemstone like a magical eye, viewing her surroundings as if her blindsense extended to 120 feet and she were under the effects of true seeing, which grants her a +4 bonus on Perception checks. Gem Gaze (Su) Shaken for 1d4 rounds, 30 feet, Fortitude DC 16 negates. The save DC is Charisma-based. A stygira can only make use of this ability while holding a gemstone. Light Blindness Despite their effective blindness, stygiras remain sensitive to light. Abrupt exposure to bright light blinds stygiras for 1 round; on subsequent rounds, they are dazzled as long as they remain in the affected area. Stone Curse (Su) Any creature struck by a stygira's claws must make a DC 18 Will save or be affected by a curse that gradually drains it of color, stiffens its joints, and finally turns the victim to stone. This curse proves frighteningly unpredictable, forcing another save against its effects every 1d3 hours. Any creature that is drained to 0 Dexterity or fails three saves against the curse is permanently petrified. Even if a creature is petrified and then restored to flesh, it is still affected by the curse and is petrified again upon failing its next save against the curse. A stone curse can only be removed in one of two ways: by casting remove curse or by spending a full hour in unobstructed natural sunlight. Magical radiance like daylight does not affect a stone curse, and remove curse does not return a petrified creature to flesh. The save DC is Constitution-based. Stone curse: Claw-curse; save Will DC 18; frequency 1/1d3 hours; effect 1d6 Dex damage, failing 3 saves results in petrification; cure casting remove curse or spending 1 hour in natural sunlight","Withered hermits wrapped in tattered black rags, these scarred, eyeless crones slip through the dark crevasses of both earth and time. Degenerate inheritors of the half-remembered, collapsed cyclops civilizations, the stygiras-or stone witches, as they are often called- command strange secrets of the earth and interpret the fateful energies of the depths. Ages of communion with the darkness and reliance upon alien magics have corrupted the stygiras from the primitive human witches their ancestors were countless ages ago, transforming them into a terrifying, debased breed infused with magics not their own. In many a savage land, these crones were once or are still worshiped as seers and demigods, weaving magic and communing with the earth to manipulate their servants into obeying their selfish and grotesque whims. In other realms, they haunt the night, prowling from their caves to feed upon the unwary or make alliances with those cruel and ambitious enough to believe their perverse counsel. Yet for all their perverse blasphemies and primitive desires, their powers to see what none should and reduce life to brittle stone proves enough to inspire dread and superstitious belief in nearly all who hear of the harsh stone witches. Stygiras on average stand 6-1/2 feet tall and weigh approximately 150 pounds. Ecology It is said that the stygiras draw their power from stone and from the darkness. Certainly they live their entire lives in the dark, traveling through intricate, maze-like caverns and the moonless sky with equal ease. They draw their sustenance from the base things they scrape from the earth-vermin, molds, lichens, and whatever fleshy things happen into their lairs. Although technically blind, stygiras have almost supernaturally keen hearing, taste, and touch, and so have no need for sight. What remains of the eyes that lurk as vestigial elements of their anatomy hide beneath the scarred flesh of their faces. While such remnant organs typically go unused, they can still detect the presence of light, an uncomfortable sensation that all stygiras take great pains to avoid. Stygiras can in fact travel under the skies, but they quickly become agoraphobic and retreat to the safety of shadowy canyons or caves as soon as possible. They avoid the sunlight hours, with most willing to face death in the darkness rather than take their chances venturing into the light. All stygiras are female; they are capable of reproducing with humanoids of nearly any species and always bearing three or more withered-and typically stillborn-stygira young. Yet stygiras make up for their appallingly low live birth and survival rates with unnaturally long lifespans. None can say how long stygiras who don't meet their end by violence might live, but instances of stone witches living for 3 or more centuries are well documented. Habitat & Society Stygiras most commonly occupy lands near the phenomenally ancient tombs and monuments of the cyclops empires. While some of the crazed witches make the impossible claim that all stygira are the surviving mortal apprentices of primordial cyclops seers, saner minds posit that the predecessors of these crones were primitive human shamans and mystics who managed to tap into a degree of the fallen empires' powers. Whatever the case, the connection between stygiras and the ancient cyclopes lingers in their shared language and the mad scrawls covering many of these hags' lairs.","<link rel=""stylesheet""href=""PF.css""><div><h2>Stygira</h2><h3><i><i>Gaunt and parched</i>, <i>this crone-like figure moves with the predatory jerkiness of a hunting vulture.

While holding or otherwise in contact with a gemstone of at least the size of a human eye, a stygira can see through the gemstone like a magical eye, viewing her surroundings as if her blindsense extended to 120 feet and she were under the <i>effect</i>s of <i>true seeing</i>, which grants her a +4 bonus on Perception checks. </h5><h5><b>Gem Gaze (Su)</b> Shaken for 1d4 rounds, 30 feet, Fortitude DC 16 negates. The <i>save</i> DC is Charisma-based. A stygira can only make use of this ability while holding a gemstone. </h5><h5><b>Light Blindness</b> Despite their <i>effect</i>ive blindness, stygiras remain sensitive to light. Abrupt exposure to bright light blinds stygiras for 1 round; on subsequent rounds, they are dazzled as long as they remain in the affected area. </h5><h5><b>Stone Curse (Su)</b> Any creature struck by a stygira's claws must make a DC 18 Will <i>save</i> or be affected by a curse that gradually drains it of color, stiffens its joints, and finally turns the victim to stone. This curse proves frighteningly unpredictable, forcing another <i>save</i> against its <i>effect</i>s every 1d3 hours. Any creature that is drained to 0 Dexterity or fails three <i>save</i>s against the curse is permanently petrified. Even if a creature is petrified and then restored to flesh, it is still affected by the curse and is petrified again upon failing its next <i>save</i> against the curse. A stone curse can only be removed in one of two ways: by casting <i>remove curse</i> or by spending a full hour in unobstructed natural sunlight. Magical radiance like <i>daylight</i> does not affect a stone curse, and <i>remove curse</i> does not return a petrified creature to flesh. The <i>save</i> DC is Constitution-based. <i>Stone curse:</i> Claw-curse; <i>save</i> Will DC 18; <i>frequency</i> 1/1d3 hours; <i>effect</i> 1d6 Dex damage, failing 3 <i>save</i>s results in petrification; <i>cure</i> casting <i>remove curse</i> or spending 1 hour in natural sunlight</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Withered hermits wrapped in tattered black rags, these scarred, eyeless crones slip through the dark crevasses of both earth and time. Degenerate inheritors of the half-remembered, collapsed cyclops civilizations, the stygiras-or stone witches, as they are often called- command strange secrets of the earth and interpret the fateful energies of the depths. Ages of communion with the darkness and reliance upon alien magics have corrupted the stygiras from the primitive human witches their ancestors were countless ages ago, transforming them into a terrifying, debased breed infused with magics not their own. In many a savage land, these crones were once or are still worshiped as seers and demigods, weaving magic and communing with the earth to manipulate their servants into obeying their selfish and grotesque whims. In other realms, they haunt the night, prowling from their caves to feed upon the unwary or make alliances with those cruel and ambitious enough to believe their perverse counsel. Yet for all their perverse blasphemies and primitive desires, their powers to see what none should and reduce life to brittle stone proves enough to inspire dread and superstitious belief in nearly all who hear of the harsh stone witches. Stygiras on average stand 6-1/2 feet tall and weigh approximately 150 pounds.<b></p><p>Ecology</b></p><p> It is said that the stygiras draw their power from stone and from the darkness. Certainly they live their entire lives in the dark, traveling through intricate, maze-like caverns and the moonless sky with equal ease. They draw their sustenance from the base things they scrape from the earth-vermin, molds, lichens, and whatever fleshy things happen into their lairs. Although technically blind, stygiras have almost supernaturally keen hearing, taste, and touch, and so have no need for sight. What remains of the eyes that lurk as vestigial elements of their anatomy hide beneath the scarred flesh of their faces. While such remnant organs typically go unused, they can still detect the presence of light, an uncomfortable sensation that all stygiras take great pains to avoid. Stygiras can in fact travel under the skies, but they quickly become agoraphobic and retreat to the safety of shadowy canyons or caves as soon as possible. They avoid the sunlight hours, with most willing to face death in the darkness rather than take their chances venturing into the light. All stygiras are female; they are capable of reproducing with humanoids of nearly any species and always bearing three or more withered-and typically stillborn-stygira young. Yet stygiras make up for their appallingly low live birth and survival rates with unnaturally long lifespans. None can say how long stygiras who don't meet their end by violence might live, but instances of stone witches living for 3 or more centuries are well documented.<b></p><p>Habitat & Society</b></p><p> Stygiras most commonly occupy lands near the phenomenally ancient tombs and monuments of the cyclops empires. While some of the crazed witches make the impossible claim that all stygira are the surviving mortal apprentices of primordial cyclops seers, saner minds posit that the predecessors of these crones were primitive human shamans and mystics who managed to tap into a degree of the fallen empires' powers. Whatever the case, the connection between stygiras and the ancient cyclopes lingers in their shared language and the mad scrawls covering many of these hags' lairs.</p></h4></div>",NULL,,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,NULL

This is a sight-based effect.","Man-eating birds of prey, the rare creatures known as stymphalides stalk the arid plains and coastlines of Golarion in ravenous swarms, shredding warm-blooded animals and unwary travelers with their bladed feathers and dagger-like beaks. From a distance, stymphalides might easily be mistaken for cranes, ibises, or other longnecked birds, though in full sunlight their gleaming feathers and the haze of blood lingering from past meals are impossible to mistake. Peculiarly, the feathers and beak of a stymphalides are made of steel, similar to the metallic hide of a gorgon. The wings of stymphalides are as sharp as knives and often lacerate their prey as the birds swarm and beat their wings against their unfortunate victims' skin. Similarly, their beaks are supernaturally sharp and can pierce the tough hides of animal prey or the armor of those warriors foolish enough to hunt the creatures. Even if a victim of a stymphalides swarm's frenzied attacks manages to fend off the vicious creatures, the wounds caused by the birds continue to bleed long after being inflicted, and the victim often perishes from loss of blood before ever reaching help. Most stymphalides stand approximately 2-1/2 feet tall and weigh little more than 40 pounds. Although mean-tempered and territorial, lone stymphalides prove relatively harmless, thus traveling in swarms of several dozen, relying on strength of numbers to bring down large or dangerous prey. Many tales also tell of enormous breeds of these monstrous birds, powerful enough to prey upon wyverns. These giant stymphalides are said to grow up to 13 feet tall and weigh over 250 pounds, with wingspans reaching upward of 25 feet. Such gigantic stymphalides are rarely seen, preferring to lurk upon desolate cliffs or even amid harsh extraplanar realms. Ecology Unlike vultures and other birds of the deserts and plains, stymphalides do not scavenge carcasses, although they are not above driving away natural scavengers if a large, fresh kill looks particularly inviting. When traveling in flocks, stymphalides prove fearless predators, swooping in and swarming any creature that wanders into their territory. The birds actively hunt their prey, harrying and killing lone individuals or stragglers. The attacks of a stymphalides swarm often prove so vicious that the creatures can take to flight once they have wounded prey, wait for it to bleed to death, and return to pick the corpse clean. Stymphalides generally avoid attacking large groups of people, unless the birds have gathered in a particularly sizable flock. Stymphalides are not purely carnivorous. A lone stymphalides might resort to eating fruit and other plants if it is separated from its flock or food is scarce, and orchards and fields of crops have been devastated by stymphalides when great swarms of the birds, starving from overpopulation or lack of prey, migrate to new territories. Yet although the birds are omnivorous, they seem to prefer meat. Those plainsfolk or desert-dwellers whose livelihoods depend on livestock have learned to fear the sight of flocks of birds silhouetted against the sky, as herds of cattle and other grazing animals have been ravaged by their swarms. Habitat & Society Most swarms of stymphalides roost near watering holes, rivers, and coastal cliffs, preying upon unfortunate creatures desperate enough to seek food or water so near to the dangerous birds' nests. The nests of stymphalides are frequently made from the bones of the creatures' prey, piled into macabre ziggurats upon which entire flocks of the birds rest. Particularly large flocks of the birds construct enormous nests, and giant stymphalides can create towers visible for miles. When not at rest, flocks of the creatures soar high on warm currents of air, relying upon their keen eyesight to spot suitable prey far below. Because of their voracious appetites, flocks of stymphalides must claim a vast swath of territory to maintain their feeding habits. Stymphalides are fiercely territorial, and flocks of the birds frequently fight with one another in swooping aerial battles to determine possession of land. Fortunately for the folk of civilized lands, stymphalides rarely encroach upon areas well traveled by humanoids and other creatures clever enough to bring down one of these metal-winged avians. Among the people of the plains, the metallic birds are often regarded as nearly legendary creatures. Stymphalides breed at an astonishing rate, however, and overpopulation and exhaustion of game frequently force extraordinarily large and deadly groups of the creatures to band together in search of new lands and new prey to devour.","<link rel=""stylesheet""href=""PF.css""><div><h2>Stymphalides,  Swarm</h2><h3><i>This cloud of long-necked birds rises into the air, screeching in a cacophony reminiscent of klaxons and clanging tools.

The save DC is Constitution-based.","Tatzlwyrms are more primeval than dragons in evolutionary terms. They branched off the family line millennia ago, and didn't advance in the same ways.  Undersized compared to their larger cousins, tatzlwyrms are ferocious in their own right. And while most other reptiles can't compare to them mentally, tatzlwyrms are hardly impressive specimens when put beside their notorious relatives. Tatzlwyrms don't possess a dragons' raw capacity for intelligence and creativity. Although they understand Draconic, other languages are beyond most tatzlwyrms' limited comprehension. Nevertheless, tatzlwyrms are deeply cunning, building complex lairs and rudimentary traps.  Tatzlwyrms are quite rare, and only a few particularly curious and lucky adventurers can claim to have seen a living specimen. Reports do agree on some basic features, however. About the size of a full-grown human, discounting their tails, tatzlwyrms have only two limbs and no wings, and there are no reports of the classic draconic breath weapons, though tatzlwyrms do possess a weak poisonous breath. An adult tatzlwyrm is 6 to 8 feet long, its long, serpentine tail adding another 6 feet or so to its length, and weighs between 400 and 500 pounds. A tatzlwyrm's scales give the creature limited camouflage, ranging through various shades of green, brown, and gray.  Most knowledge of these smaller dragons comes from folklore local to areas with active nests. Peasants use tatzlwyrms as a sort of bogeyman, an excuse used any time a villager goes missing-""the tatzlwyrms took ΓÇÿem!"" Often, when hunters fail to nab their quarries, tatzlwyrms become the scapegoats-""I would have had that elk, but a tatzlwyrm grabbed him before I could take my shot."" Some of these stories probably do have merit, however; tatzlwyrms are notoriously vicious, particularly to any creatures invading their territories, and those on the wrong end of their bites rarely survive.  Ecology Like full dragons, tatzlwyrms are strict carnivores. They spend most of their time hiding, waiting to attack any prey that ventures too near. They consume their food slowly in their lairs, in the dark security and seclusion they thrive on. Tatzlwyrms have a remarkable knack for ambush and camouflage.  Tatzlwyrms are capable of rudimentary trapping. They exhibit a surprising knowledge of appealing foods to use as bait for their prey. For example, a tatzlwyrm female may leave a fresh rabbit carcass or a pile of fruit outside its lair. When a larger animal approaches, the tatzlwyrm takes advantage of the creature's vulnerability while eating and pounces from a privileged vantage point.  Then she drags the body into her lair to be consumed at her leisure.  Tatzlwyrms detest open spaces. They inhabit solely out-of-the-way locales that are full of obstructions to better facilitate their ambushes. Locations rife with weakened obstacles such as rotten or fallen trees or other difficult terrain are especially preferred, as they act as natural traps.  While there are a several varieties of tatzlwyrm, all breeds have a few universal traits. Every tatzlwyrm has a row of long spines running from the top of its head to the end of its tail. They also possess dewlaps of spikelike scales hanging under their necks. These spikes and spines give the creatures a larger appearance, frightening away the few predators capable of causing tatzlwyrms significant harm, and also offer limited protection to vulnerable spots.  Able to see in pitch darkness, the tatzlwyrm's daylight vision is full-color; they are quite capable of sensing movement at long distances. Their vision is heavily triggered by bright colors and rapid motion, this being a tool they use to better respond to food and threats. They also have limited sense of smell, responding strongly to chemicals and pheromones. Creatures in heat are bound to draw unwanted and potentially fatal attention from any nearby tatzlwyrms.  Tatzlwyrms live between 20 and 30 years if allowed to survive to old age, reaching full size after only 6 months of rapid growth.  Habitat & Society Nesting is core to a tatzlwyrm's day-to-day existence.  Natural burrowing is beyond their basic capabilities, and laziness prevents them from complex and timeconsuming tasks like constructing more elaborate lairs, so tatzlwyrms nest in naturally hollow areas such as large trees, caves, or under overhangs, where they can make dry nests.  Tatzlwyrms retain the hoarding instincts of their draconic relatives, maintaining dens full of bones and various items torn from their prey, though tatzlwyrms have little concept of the value of such objects.  They have a special interest in shiny things, and tatzlwyrms usually have a disproportionate number of small gems and other glittering trinkets (both worthless and valuable) in their small hoards. In many cases, tatzlwyrms dedicate more time to hiding their hoards than building their nests.  Female tatzlwyrms attract males with scent signatures, inviting them into their dens. After mating, the female hibernates for upward of a month during gestation until she produces eggs, while the male guards the nest. During mating season, tatzlwyrms maintain small, temporary family units, but hatchlings only stay in the nest for a few months before being driven out. Afterwards, the mated pair breaks up, often violently.  Vicious in mating as in all things, nearly half of all tatzlwyrm pairings result in the death of one or even both participants. Tatzlwyrms average between one and three surviving whelps out of an annual clutch of eggs, so they rarely multiply rapidly.  The various breeds of tatzlwyrm owe distinction primarily in their preferred habitats. The vast majority dwell within deep forests, living amongst dead trees and bogs. The rarest breeds have a preference for volcanoes, and bear a natural resistance to fire.  While generally quite patient, tatzlwyrms have tempers beyond compare. Once provoked, they fight to the death. Their jaws are powerful, and they refuse to let go until an enemy is dead. Against most targets, this means snapping their jaws around a victim's neck and shaking until blood loss or a broken neck ends the struggle. A tatzlwyrm's poison, while not particularly potent, helps subdue enemies less capable of resistance.  Unlike many animals, a tatzlwyrm's killer instinct doesn't end with the death of the creature in its jaws.  Often, if other creatures are moving in the vicinity of a kill, the tatzlwyrm pursues them as well once it has dealt with the threat at hand.","<link rel=""stylesheet""href=""PF.css""><div><h2>tatzlwyrm, Tatzlwyrm</h2><h3><i>Yellow eyes briefly flicker from a hole in a nearby maple tree.

The save DC is Constitution-based.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Tatzlwyrms are more primeval than dragons in evolutionary terms. They branched off the family line millennia ago, and didn't advance in the same ways.</p><p>Undersized compared to their larger cousins, tatzlwyrms are ferocious in their own right. And while most other reptiles can't compare to them mentally, tatzlwyrms are hardly impressive specimens when put beside their notorious relatives. Tatzlwyrms don't possess a dragons' raw capacity for intelligence and creativity. Although they understand Draconic, other languages are beyond most tatzlwyrms' limited comprehension. Nevertheless, tatzlwyrms are deeply cunning, building complex lairs and rudimentary traps.</p><p>Tatzlwyrms are quite rare, and only a few particularly curious and lucky adventurers can claim to have seen a living specimen. Reports do agree on some basic features, however. About the size of a full-grown human, discounting their tails, tatzlwyrms have only two limbs and no wings, and there are no reports of the classic draconic breath weapons, though tatzlwyrms do possess a weak poisonous breath. An adult tatzlwyrm is 6 to 8 feet long, its long, serpentine tail adding another 6 feet or so to its length, and weighs between 400 and 500 pounds. A tatzlwyrm's scales give the creature limited camouflage, ranging through various shades of green, brown, and gray.</p><p>Most knowledge of these smaller dragons comes from folklore local to areas with active nests. Peasants use tatzlwyrms as a sort of bogeyman, an excuse used any time a villager goes missing-""the tatzlwyrms took ΓÇÿem!"" Often, when hunters fail to nab their quarries, tatzlwyrms become the scapegoats-""I would have had that elk, but a tatzlwyrm grabbed him before I could take my shot."" Some of these stories probably do have merit, however; tatzlwyrms are notoriously vicious, particularly to any creatures invading their territories, and those on the wrong end of their bites rarely survive.<b></p><p>Ecology</b><br></br> Like full dragons, tatzlwyrms are strict carnivores. They spend most of their time hiding, waiting to attack any prey that ventures too near. They consume their food slowly in their lairs, in the dark security and seclusion they thrive on. Tatzlwyrms have a remarkable knack for ambush and camouflage.</p><p>Tatzlwyrms are capable of rudimentary trapping. They exhibit a surprising knowledge of appealing foods to use as bait for their prey. For example, a tatzlwyrm female may leave a fresh rabbit carcass or a pile of fruit outside its lair. When a larger animal approaches, the tatzlwyrm takes advantage of the creature's vulnerability while eating and pounces from a privileged vantage point.</p><p>Then she drags the body into her lair to be consumed at her leisure.</p><p>Tatzlwyrms detest open spaces. They inhabit solely out-of-the-way locales that are full of obstructions to better facilitate their ambushes. Locations rife with weakened obstacles such as rotten or fallen trees or other difficult terrain are especially preferred, as they act as natural traps.</p><p>While there are a several varieties of tatzlwyrm, all breeds have a few universal traits. Every tatzlwyrm has a row of long spines running from the top of its head to the end of its tail. They also possess dewlaps of spikelike scales hanging under their necks. These spikes and spines give the creatures a larger appearance, frightening away the few predators capable of causing tatzlwyrms significant harm, and also offer limited protection to vulnerable spots.</p><p>Able to see in pitch darkness, the tatzlwyrm's daylight vision is full-color; they are quite capable of sensing movement at long distances. Their vision is heavily triggered by bright colors and rapid motion, this being a tool they use to better respond to food and threats. They also have limited sense of smell, responding strongly to chemicals and pheromones. Creatures in heat are bound to draw unwanted and potentially fatal attention from any nearby tatzlwyrms.</p><p>Tatzlwyrms live between 20 and 30 years if allowed to survive to old age, reaching full size after only 6 months of rapid growth.<b></p><p>Habitat & Society</b><br></br> Nesting is core to a tatzlwyrm's day-to-day existence.</p><p>Natural burrowing is beyond their basic capabilities, and laziness prevents them from complex and timeconsuming tasks like constructing more elaborate lairs, so tatzlwyrms nest in naturally hollow areas such as large trees, caves, or under overhangs, where they can make dry nests.</p><p>Tatzlwyrms retain the hoarding instincts of their draconic relatives, maintaining dens full of bones and various items torn from their prey, though tatzlwyrms have little concept of the value of such objects.</p><p>They have a special interest in shiny things, and tatzlwyrms usually have a disproportionate number of small gems and other glittering trinkets (both worthless and valuable) in their small hoards.

Ogre-like in stature and dimwittedness, these monstrously ugly humanoids bear fold upon fold of sagging, excess flesh, draping them in wrinkled, poxriddled hides. This wretched appearance, in tandem with their great size and monstrous claws, leads most creatures to shun them. Indeed, even thawns find one another repulsive, creating a barely tolerable society of universal mistrust and loathing. Thawns average 9 feet tall and their excess skin pushes their average weight to 700 pounds. Ecology Often called ""mud giants"" due to the foul, mottled skin that hangs loosely from their misshapen frames, thawns are universally malformed and dreadful, though each is quite distinctive in its singular monstrousness. Hair only grows in small tufts-thick, oily, and black. Their eyes easily pick up the flaws in their appearance, driving them to hide their figures as much as possible. Such revulsion of their form has led many scholars to hypothesize that thawns once possessed a different one, potentially relating them directly to ogres, hill giants, or other humanoids victimized by the hands of some more powerful and malicious race. Such possibilities remain nothing more than conjecture, however, as the brutes have no ability and even less interest in retaining details of their history. Even with this overpowering self-loathing, ancient instincts drive thawns together for safety and procreation, and no other race tolerates their ugliness and savagery. Opportunistic feeders, thawns seek out fresh battlefields and the scraps of slain beasts, reluctantly sharing their pickings with other parasites and scavengers. Alone as they wander the lands, thawns take care of their own needs first and foremost, caring little for others of their kind. Disdaining anything like a fair fight, they excel at crafting clever decoys and simple traps. Though sizable creatures, thawns typically strive to draw as little attention to themselves as possible, preferring to craft convincing dummies from mud, stone, and animal carcasses while they wait in hiding. Habitat & Society Most thawns collect in nomadic groups, wandering grim plains and moody hills more like ravaging gangs than tribes traveling out of necessity. While their dim intellects provide them the most basic tools to seek out what they need to survive, their lives prove pitiful and often violently short. Hateful of themselves and their own kind, thawns aspire to no great works. Their nomadism thus comes less from need as from indifference, as one ugly hillside or leaking cave proves little better or worse than any other. It's their own inhabitance that causes most thawns to move on, as once they've despoiled an area, it's then time to find new lands. This cycle of pillaging and pressing on proves uncomfortable to most thawns, but most lack the foresight to live any other way. Groups of thawns prove highly changeable, with members joining and leaving with little hesitation. As no love is lost between members, the savages drift apart as the whim takes them. Typically such changes in group structure go ignored, unless those left behind believe their former kinsman possesses some valuable information or reason for departing. Thawns don't believe in hoarding material possessions, disdaining most metals and valuables in part because shiny surfaces invariably betray their monstrous visages to them. They use whatever is nearest at hand to satisfy their basic needs, though some carry with them items of simple usefulness or trophies of brutal victories. They move away from defended and civilized areas out of simple survival instinct, but attack small groups of humanoids if driven to desperation. Occasionally some uninformed samaritan attempts to take pity on a thawn, believing it cast out merely for its appearance and simplicity. Such charity typically proves fatal, though, as in the case of these hulks, their outward ugliness matches a dull-witted sadism and raving, violent hatred of all living things. Even ogres, with whom they hold many similarities, revile thawns as mindless killers and bogeymen, attacking and slaying them on sight. If mud giants excel at any one thing, it's physical deception. Knowing most creatures' hatred of them and their widespread treatment as dangerous lepers, they have learned to hide themselves where no sane creature would lurk and deceive eyes that would seek them with loathing. Thus, thawns willingly lair and hide amid filth-choked pools, muddy ravines, rotting bogs, and worse places. To aid them in their ambushes, they often create cunningly hidden pits, similar simple traps, and, most notoriously, decoys. With their misshapen frames, it's not difficult to mistake a tall, awkward pile of mud and rocks covered in rags for a thawn, while the reverse also proves dangerously true. More than one wary traveler, sighting a thawn-like shape upon a low hillock or on a dusty trail, has circled widely to avoid the dangerous hunter only to blunder into the ambush of the true thawn lurking in wait. Treasure Thawns rarely keep any possessions other than those which they can carry, these typically being crude or foul items even the most desperate wayfarers wouldn't consider clothing or food. In filthy sacks or-even more revoltingly- slung in useful flesh folds, there is a 40% chance that any thawn possesses 1d4 unsettling items, typically scraps of skin, leather, and stolen cloth for the creation of new cloaks; trophies of skulls, bones, and hide bound into crude fetishes; and rotting animal meat of unwholesome cuts and uncertain origin. Such things are typically soiled beyond use and rarely valuable, but often suggest what victims the mud giant has recently preyed upon and where their foul wanderings have led them.","<link rel=""stylesheet""href=""PF.css""><div><h2>Thawn</h2><h3><i>A hulking humanoid cloaked in ragged cloth limps forward, its malformed, tumorous arms ending in claws the length of scythe blades.

Such charity typically proves fatal, though, as in the case of these hulks, their outward ugliness matches a dull-witted sadism and raving, violent hatred of all living things.</p><p>Even ogres, with whom they hold many similarities, revile thawns as mindless killers and bogeymen, attacking and slaying them on sight.</p><p>If mud giants excel at any one thing, it's physical deception. Knowing most creatures' hatred of them and their widespread treatment as dangerous lepers, they have learned to hide themselves where no sane creature would lurk and deceive eyes that would seek them with loathing.</p><p>Thus, thawns willingly lair and hide amid filth-choked pools, muddy ravines, rotting bogs, and worse places. To aid them in their ambushes, they often create cunningly hidden pits, similar simple traps, and, most notoriously, decoys.</p><p>With their misshapen frames, it's not difficult to mistake a tall, awkward pile of mud and rocks covered in rags for a thawn, while the reverse also proves dangerously true. More than one wary traveler, sighting a thawn-like shape upon a low hillock or on a dusty trail, has circled widely to avoid the dangerous hunter only to blunder into the ambush of the true thawn lurking in wait.</p><p><b>Treasure</b><br> Thawns rarely keep any possessions other than those which they can carry, these typically being crude or foul items even the most desperate wayfarers wouldn't consider clothing or food.</p><p>In filthy sacks or-even more revoltingly- slung in useful flesh folds, there is a 40% chance that any thawn possesses 1d4 unsettling items, typically scraps of skin, leather, and stolen cloth for the creation of new cloaks; trophies of skulls, bones, and hide bound into crude fetishes; and rotting animal meat of unwholesome cuts and uncertain origin. Such things are typically soiled beyond use and rarely valuable, but often suggest what victims the mud giant has recently preyed upon and where their foul wanderings have led them.</p></h4></div>",NULL,,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,NULL

They typically hunt alone, only occasionally forming small packs. Thylacines hunt at night, and rest during the day in nests hidden away from the world in hollowed trees or bushes. Farmers fear the creatures, blaming all manner of problems on them. However, thylacines are quite shy and antisocial, and usually avoid human settlements. Because of their odd, almost hybrid appearance, thylacines have a far harsher reputation than they probably should, playing a sort of bogeyman role in farming communities. Ecology At a distance, thylacines are sometimes mistaken for dogs or jackals, but can be easily identified by the defining stripes on their gold-hued backs. Thylacines usually have between 13 and 21 dark stripes. Their muscular jaws, filled with teeth, can gape open to an impressive 120 degrees. While thylacines may appear rather quick, they are far from proficient runners. Due to their oddly shaped legs, their run is awkward and slow. However, the animals can stand on their haunches for short periods, helping them to fend off other predators and kill larger prey. Thylacines are also capable jumpers, not dissimilar to kangaroos, and often surprise opponents with this ability. By most standards, a thylacine's senses aren't impressive. They can see and hear well enough to hunt prey, but their olfactory senses, while competent, do not approach canine levels. Thylacines hunt in a manner similar to wolves, focusing on wearing down prey by chasing and harrying instead of direct attacks. Their stomachs are able to greatly distend, enabling thylacines to eat vast amounts of food in a single sitting, devouring larger animals to compensate for long periods of drought or poor hunting. Thylacines are quite cowardly, avoiding confrontation whenever possible. If cornered, a thylacine tries to frighten off attackers with growls, hisses, and threat-yawns, in which it displays its teeth and the full extent of its wide jaws. If these threat displays are ineffective, however, a thylacine does not hesitate to attack. Their powerful jaws may not snap bones, but they can still make quick work of an unprepared traveler. In addition, thylacines are not picky eaters. If driven to starvation, they aren't afraid to hunt humans, in which case their nocturnal hunting cycles tend to lead them to attack sleeping travelers or outlying farms. Thylacines are fiercely independent. While wolves and other canines can be tamed and domesticated, thylacines are wild without exception. If captured, they become territorial and mark everything they can in their territories with strong-smelling odors from their scent glands. Many a farmer has made the sad mistake of attempting to domesticate a thylacine, only to find his farm smelling atrocious and his livestock killed in the night. An adult thylacine stands 2 feet tall at the shoulder, is 4 feet long (not counting an additional 2 feet of tail), and weighs roughly 50 pounds. The larger and more aggressive brush thylacine breed can reach almost 8 feet long from nose to tail-tip, though still only weighing 100 pounds. Habitat & Society Thylacines breed year-round, but like most marsupials, they don't maintain strong family ties. Females keep their young in pouches. Unlike many marsupials, males also have pouches, but these are to protect their genitals, not their young. Females produce about 10 viable joeys in a given breeding season, but only about four can expect to see more than a year of life. The average thylacine lives between 4 and 10 years. Thylacines keep dens similar to those of plains mammals such as foxes and cougars. Dens are often very hard to find, in trees, caves, or other inconvenient locations out of the way of most predators, and in natural shade. Thylacine young reside in the den for only a short period, as joeys stay in their mothers' pouches for most of their development. During periods when a mother is incubating her young, she can be downright violent to trespassers or any other potential threats. Regional Variants Several breeds of thylacine are known to exist, hunting plains and woodlands in regions of Avistan, Garund, and beyond. Three of the most common are noted here. Blood Cougar: Not actually related to the big cats, Tian thylacines are known as blood cougars for their vivid red coloring. Surprisingly, they are often kept as pets by Tian-La leaders, as blood cougars are more easily domesticated and tamed, and serve as far better companions and hunting aids. Although they are slightly smaller than normal thylacines, they make up for it in ferocity and cunning. These red beasts have the advanced creature template (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 294). Casmar Thylacine: In Casmaron, most thylacines are smaller than the typical beast. For this reason, they tend to form larger packs, often twice the size of an average thylacine pack. These smaller beasts stand 6 inches to a foot shorter at the shoulders. Casmar thylacines are normal thylacines with the young creature template added (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 295), and gather in packs of 2-10. Sarusan Wolf: The Sarusan wolf is a slightly bigger and more doglike form of the normal thylacine. Whereas indigenous people refer to the thylacine as a lion or other great cat, the Sarusan wolf has an unmistakable canine jaw. While they are physically larger, Sarusan wolves are actually less hardy than their traditional cousins, due to poor weight allocation. Prone to tiring quickly and falling down, Sarusan wolves focus more on rapid takedowns of their prey. Sarusan wolves have a Constitution score of 12 and gain Power Attack as a bonus feat.

The save DC is Constitution-based.","Slavering and voracious, trollhounds almost seem to be trolls in smaller canine form and indeed are often found as pets among gangs and tribes of trolls. Requiring vast amounts of food to power their regenerative metabolisms, wild trollhound packs range far and wide through the mountains of the north, their ravenous hunger driving them to hunt and consume any prey they can track down and kill. A typical trollhound stands 3-4 feet tall at the shoulder; has short, powerful legs; and weighs around 350 pounds. Trollhounds' skin is somewhat scaly, with patches of rough, greenish-black fur. They have oversized jaws with a pronounced underbite, and their eyes are normally a dull, hateful orange. Ecology Trollhounds are believed to be the outcome of infusing particularly ferocious worgs with alchemically prepared troll blood. The resulting beast loses the worg's evil intelligence but gains the ability to regenerate even the most grievous wounds, except those inflicted by fire or acid. Whatever their origin, trollhounds breed true and are often raised by trolls. Trollhounds are fearless on the hunt and in combat, relying on their ability to regenerate to carry them through. Not even fire is enough to repel them, as the beasts are apparently too dull to recognize the danger it poses to them. Nevertheless, fire is one of the most effective tools in combating trollhounds, and canny hunters know to burn every last remnant of a slain trollhound, for as is true of trolls, even the smallest piece of trollhound flesh will eventually regrow into a full-sized trollhound. The trollhound's ability to regenerate requires vast amounts of food, like that of trolls, and trollhounds spend the majority of their lives on an endless hunt. They are normally carnivorous but will eat almost anything to assuage their voracious appetites, though vegetable matter proves a poor substitute for fresh meat. Trollhounds consume the entirety of their kills, leaving very little for scavengers. A powerful digestive system and quick metabolism make short work of fur, scales, hooves, horns, antlers, and even bones. Only stone and metal are later excreted, coated in foul-smelling slurry. Trollhound females give birth to litters of up to a dozen pups, but only rarely does more than half that number survive to adulthood. Although trollhound pups are able to regenerate at birth and are born with a full set of teeth and claws, most fall victim to the hunger of their littermates or parents. Domesticated trollhound pups often meet the same fate as snacks for hungry juvenile trolls. Trollhound mothers feed their pups strips of meat from their own flesh until the pups are old enough to hunt for themselves, usually after about a year. Barring misfortune, a trollhound can live up to 20 years, though most die long before that, killed and devoured by their packmates or troll masters. Habitat & Society Trollhounds are most often found in the company of trolls, who breed the beasts as hunters, guards, pets, and food. Trollhounds seem to have an affinity for their giant masters, and tamed trollhounds always regard trolls as alpha members of the pack. Usually, a domesticated trollhound bonds with one particular troll. Thereafter, a trollhound fights to the death to defend its bonded troll, willingly laying down its life for its master. Unfortunately for most trollhounds, their troll masters rarely return this devotion. In times of hardship when food is scarce, a tribe's trollhounds are usually the first item on the menu. When not eating them for sustenance, trolls use trollhounds as guards for their lairs, as few trolls have the patience or attention span for long stretches of boring guard duty. Trolls also use trollhounds to aid them in their own hunts. Armed with an incredibly sensitive sense of smell, a trollhound can track prey for miles, often leading its troll masters to a den, lair, or settlement containing even more food. Once a hunt is successful, trolls and trollhounds share their kills, tearing indiscriminately into their prey and squabbling over scraps. In the wild, trollhounds form packs under the leadership of an alpha male. Such packs usually contain only half a dozen adult trollhounds or so-when a pack grows larger, its members invariably fight one another for dominance. Those too weak to defend their position in the pack end up as food for the more dominant members, reducing the pack to a more manageable size. Only the alpha male and alpha female are allowed to mate, producing one litter at a time whenever the previous set of pups reaches adulthood. Fights for mating rights also serve to keep a pack's numbers in check. Trollhound dens are usually located among mountainous crags, frequently in small natural caves. A single pack can claim quite a large territory and hunts all manner of life in the region until it is depleted, at which point the pack moves on to a new territory. A trollhound pack does not tolerate any rival packs in its territory, and territorial disputes are common. Rather than drive away rivals, the victorious trollhound pack claims a free meal. Variant Trollhounds Some reports claim that scrags have bred their own aquatic version of trollhounds. These ""scraghounds"" are said to possess crocodile- or shark-like jaws filled with teeth and to smell blood in the water over great distances. Scraghounds possess the aquatic subtype and the amphibious special quality. They have a base land speed of 20 feet, a swim speed of 30 feet, and the keen scent special ability (see page 247 of the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary). A scraghound's bite inflicts 1d8 points of damage, and its regeneration ability only works when the creature is submerged in water. The powerful subterranean rock trolls have also developed their own breed of trollhounds. Rock trollhounds have hard, pebbly skin that gives them a +8 natural armor bonus. They lack the regeneration ability of other trollhound variants but gain fast healing 3 when underground and touching natural earth. Like rock trolls, rock trollhounds are vulnerable to sunlight. A rock trollhound that is exposed to sunlight (not merely a daylight spell) can only take a single move or attack action and is instantly turned to stone (as if by a flesh to stone spell) in the next round if it fails a DC 17 Fortitude save. A rock trollhound must make a new saving throw each round it remains in sunlight. This effect ends at night, once the trollhound is no longer exposed to sunlight. Training Trollhounds The ravenous hunger and ferocious disposition of trollhounds makes them difficult to train under even the best circumstances. Taming a trollhound requires 4 weeks of work and a DC 25 Handle Animal check. Once a trollhound has been tamed, it can be further trained, though all DCs to do so are increased by 10. Using fire while training trollhounds grants a +2 circumstance bonus on skill checks. Trolls gain a +15 racial bonus on Handle Animal checks to tame or train a trollhound. Even when domesticated, trollhounds remain difficult to manage and must be kept well fed at all times. More than once, a brave but careless trainer has met his end in the jaws of his hungry charges.","<link rel=""stylesheet""href=""PF.css""><div><h2>Trollhound</h2><h3><i><i>Vaguely canine in appearance</i>, <i>this squat</i>, <i>powerful beast sniffs the air hungrily.

Doing so requires an ukobach to make a DC 15 Wisdom check as it impresses its will upon the fire. This DC increases by +5 for every size category of the flame above Small. If an ukobach succeeds, the flame animates with the statistics of a fire elemental of the same size, and follows the ukobach's mental commands. The flames remain animate for a number of rounds equal to the ukobach's Wisdom modifier-usually 3-after which they return to being simple flames, setting the square they cease moving in alight or being extinguished, as their surroundings warrant. Up to five ukobachs can make use of the aid another action to each grant an adjacent ukobach a +2 bonus on this Wisdom check to animate flames (granting a maximum +10 bonus). Fire Leap (Su) As a swift action, an ukobach occupying the same space as a fire, pool of lava, vent of searing steam, or similar blaze can teleport from that burning feature and emerge from another within 100 feet. This ability functions similarly to the spell dimension door, but only between fires. Upon entering a flame, an ukobach is instantly aware of all flames within range through which it might exit. If an ukobach enters a flame and there are no others to exit through within 100 feet, the devil's movement immediately ends and it is stunned for 1 round. Firebreathing (Su) An ukobach can spend a standard action to guzzle a pint of oil, alcohol, or similarly flammable fluid and hold the combustible liquid within its body. At any point within 10 minutes of doing so, the ukobach can expel the liquid either as a 10-foot cone of fire or a 20-foot line of flame, both dealing 3d6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 13 for half). Upon breathing fire an ukobach cannot make use of this ability again until it drinks another pint of oil. The save DC is Constitution-based. Scorch (Su) An ukobach's touch is searing hot, causing its claws and any metal weapon it grasps to deal an additional 1d4 points of fire damage.","Maniacal and clever, ukobachs embody the tenacity and ever advancing genius of Hell. Legions of these tiny devils labor throughout the it, and from their efforts rise new heresies and tools of depravity. They revel in the fires of Hell and manipulate them not toward destruction, but to the creation of ever greater and more innovative diabolical ends. The keepers of Hell's furnaces, they delight in their mad work, breaking only to torment the damned with their burning tools or newest inventions. Ukobachs stand approximately 3-1/2 feet tall and weigh 70 pounds on average. Their fire pokers are fundamentally tied to their beings and disintegrate in a flash of cinders and ash upon the devil's death. These tools hold up to 10 fistsized embers, which an ukobach can fling at its enemies. Ecology Born from the burning depths of Hell, ukobachs find themselves most at home amid the choking and sultry pits where mortals dare not delve, proving well adapted to such stifling environs. While they must breathe, they prove equally well adapted to breathing smoke, cinders, and steam as air. Like all devils, the ukobachs' infernal eyes gaze through even the most stygian night, but unlike their brethren, they dislike the dark. While they harbor no fear of darkness and certainly see its value when tormenting mortals, they view it largely as a waste, seeking to dispel even the most fleeting shadow with an explosion of flame. Habitat & Society Most ukobachs originate from the flaming canals of Dis or the fiery pits of Phlegethon. Although rarely born from Moloch's crematoriums at the heart of Citadel Ba'al, hordes of ukobach furnace keepers tend the flames of the archdevil's ceremonial ovens. Devastating ukobach engineers also tinker in the foundries at the heart of Phlegethon, creating ingenious devices of intentional or incidental immolation-some infernal rumors claim a particularly insidious ukobach inspired the invention of the first fireworks, leaving these devils with a universal love of such creations. On the mortal plane, ukobachs gravitate to cities. While many metropolises prove ill prepared to defend against the flames these devils delight in spreading, most ukobachs take more subtle approaches, finding lairs in abandoned smithies, large furnaces, stone ruins, and other places likely to survive the occasional errant flame. While indisputably pyromaniacal, ukobachs are more than merely crazed marauders. Seeing a small hovel, pile of leaves, or alley cat burn is nothing to creatures born from the flames of Hell. Rather, they enjoy the order and progression of flames, exalting in striking the spark that ignites a wildfire, upturning the lantern that sets a whole city quarter aflame, or immolating the leader whose death results in the dispersal of a formerly devout congregation. Further satisfying their methodological obsessions, ukobachs prefer setting elaborate traps for their victims over direct combat, often turning whole structures into burning deathtraps, trapping and retrapping the same location, or setting obvious snares that cause their quarries to overlook more devious ambushes. These impish devils understand the use of flammable fluids and materials well, often employing barrels of oil, casks of alcohol, heaps of coal, and even alchemical items like tindertwigs in their creations. Among diabolists, it is said that all ukobachs know the secret of creating berith, an alchemical element by which any material might be distilled into gold. Stories tell of ukobachs trading knowledge of this element for wild prices or only after an alchemist gathers components from exotic lands. Such tales often offer blatant moral lessons and warnings against these unnatural obsessions, such as the Taldan author and former alchemist Smardina's cryptic and symbol-laden work Shagreen, wherein an obsessed alchemist adventures across the world and ultimately trades an ukobach 23 years of his life, only to find his age and journeys have made his hands too crippled to work-he dies soon after and is dragged to Hell in a golden coffin. Summoning Ukobachs Ukobachs prove unusually congenial when it comes to answering the summons of many diabolists, especially those with an obvious creative streak, interest in alchemy, or queries regarding the inventions of Hell. Any diabolist who draws the magic circle necessary to bind an ukobach with mercury or silver powder, or who lights their diabolical summoning with chemical fire rather than normal oil or tinder, increases how difficult an ukobach finds it to escape from the magical trap by +2. Additionally, a diabolist gains a +2 bonus on the opposed Charisma check made to obtain an ukobach's service if the task involves creating alchemical or metallurgical works, or otherwise involves fire. In addition, ukobachs who know and favor their summoner sometimes bring gifts with them from Hell. While on the surface such boons might seem like blessings, they are always carefully selected by an ukobach and meant to encourage a summoner toward a destructive end. Commonly, such infernal gifts take the form of fireworks and explosives-especially in lands where such creations are uncommon-inscrutable blueprints or formulas for fiendish devices or magic items, or powerfully volatile alchemical reagents.","<link rel=""stylesheet""href=""PF.css""><div><h2>Devil, Ukobach</h2><h3><i>The light of a flaming pitchfork illuminates a creepily malformed little man, his red skin scarred and raw like the victim of horrific burns.

As such, all of an uniila's spells (not her spell-like abilities) are strange and terrible to behold. This increases the Spellcraft DC required to identify an uniila's spell as it is being cast by +5. In addition, at will, an uniila can choose to make a spell she casts particularly frightening. Any creature forced to make a saving throw to resist a spell cast by an uniila must make an additional Will save at the same DC or be shaken for 1 round. This effect can potentially increase the severity of other fear effects. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. Infernal Arcana (Su) Once per day, after spending a minute whispering strange formulas and cosmic truths, an uniila can grant an adjacent mortal spellcaster additional profane insight into the ways of magic. This counts as a bonus spell prepared or spell per day of 6th level or lower, which is immediately accessible by the target in addition to all its regular spells. The uniila chooses what spell to grant the target. It need not be a spell already known by the target, though it must be of 6th level or lower and of a level he can cast or from his class's spell list. This spell remains available to the target for 24 hours. The spell can be any arcane or divine spell. An uniila can never use this ability on herself or non-mortal targets. Once a target chooses to make use of this spell, it is cast at the uniila's caster level (typically 8th) and is treated as having the evil subtype. In addition, as the uniila chooses, she may spontaneously add the effects of any metamagic feat to the spell (without the spell being treated as though it were of an increased spell level). Typically, uniilas use this ability to compel magic users to rely on them for more powerful magic, though they might also use effects like Widen Spell to affect unintended targets. Scroll Mastery (Su) All uniilas possess Scribe Scroll as a bonus feat. An uniila is treated as knowing all spells of 6th level or lower in the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook and can create scrolls of any of those spells. Whether an uniila knows rarer magic is decided by the GM. Summon Devil (Su) Once per day, an uniila can attempt to summon 2d4 imps with a 55% chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of a 4th-level spell. Witch Token (Su) By spending an hour in concentration, an uniila can create a token of arcane power. This token may take any form that takes up an item slot, and typically appears as a subtly fiendish ring, amulet, or similar piece of jewelry. While it is worn by a mortal, all of the DCs of any spells the wearer casts increase by +1 (this effect stacks with Spell Focus). However, while wearing a witch token, the bearer takes a -5 penalty on all saves made to resist spells and effects cast by the token's creation. Also, while the token is being worn, the uniila can effectively scry through the token at will and without the wearer's knowledge as long as he remains on the same plane. Spells and effects that typically bar or confound scry also affect the witch token. As a standard action, an uniila can cause her witch token to erupt in a burst of destructive magic that deals 10d6 points of damage to the wearer. An uniila can only ever have one witch token in existence at a time and must destroy a previously created token before creating a new one. The damage of this effect is based on the uniila's Hit Dice. All witch tokens are also under effects similar to magic aura, and are detected as possessing auras of moderate universal magic. Those who use identify or a similar spell must succeed at a DC 20 Will save to receive correct information (that the token sheds an aura of strong divination). Detect evil reveals no aura from a witch token. The saving throw is Charisma-based.","The tools devils use to ensnare the minds and ultimately the souls of their victims vary incredibly, from the most blatant of infernal corruptions to enticements that seem not like temptations at all. The elusive cabal devils, or uniilas as they are known by diabolists, employ one of the most seductive drugs in existence in their snares: magic. Mistresses of the arcane with an understanding of the cultic arts-both arcane and divine-that rivals even that of many greater fiends, these mysterious and aloof sages haunt the most ancient ruins and moldering depths of Stygia, the fifth layer of Hell, researching arcana and puzzling over formulae destined to shake the cosmos. When conjured forth or left to their own devices upon the Material Plane, uniilas make no untoward offers or forceful demands of their mortal hosts; they merely offer greater magical power in any of the various ways they might do so. Should the ease with which such might is granted pollute a mortal's ambitions or lead him to rely upon a devil for his power, such ultimately proves the student's fault, not the eager teacher's. So too does the resulting damnation at the end of the mortal's short life prove more of his own doing than any overt diabolical trap, making uniilas' methods all the more sinister for their subtlety. Summoning Cabal Devils Uniilas eagerly seek passage to the Material Plane and as such welcome summons by mortal casters. Whether to experiment with spells, seek out new magic, or corrupt mortals with their knowledge, what plots an uniila holds often prove inscrutable and of secondary interest to a summoner. Tempering their desire to reach the mortal plane, an uniila's vanity prevents it from serving a witless or hopeless summoner. Thus, uniilas turn the act of summoning about on those who call upon them via a planar binding spell, requesting that such mortals demonstrate their spellcasting prowess. If the mortal effectively casts a spell the uniila does not know (not one of those spells she possesses as a sorcerer spell or spell-like ability), or performs a spell of 5th-level or higher, the caster gains a +2 bonus on the opposed Charisma check made to bind the devil. Occasionally, an uniila purposefully remains to serve an inferior spellcaster, or one that fails his opposed Charisma check. Granting the inept tools they should never possess amuses the devils, and even the most incompetent ""masters"" might prove useful in seeking out components of an uniila's ongoing projects in Hell.","<link rel=""stylesheet""href=""PF.css""><div><h2>Devil, Cabal (Uniila)</h2><h3><i>The curves of a shapely maiden define the outline of a mysterious figure wrapped in mist and strips of ancient robes.

They look much as they did in life, often becoming more attractive, though some have a hardened, feral look instead. Creating a Vampire ""Vampire"" is an acquired template that can be added to any living creature with 5 or more Hit Dice (referred to hereafter as the base creature). Most vampires were once humanoids, fey, or monstrous humanoids. A vampire uses the base creature's stats and abilities except as noted here. CR: Same as the base creature + 2. AL: Any evil. Type: The creature's type changes to undead (augmented). Do not recalculate class Hit Dice, BAB, or saves. Senses: A vampire gains darkvision 60 ft. Armor Class: Natural armor improves by +6. Hit Dice: Change all racial Hit Dice to d8s. Class Hit Dice are unaffected. As undead, vampires use their Charisma modifier to determine bonus hit points (instead of Constitution). Defensive Abilities: A vampire gains channel resistance +4, DR 10/magic and silver, and resistance to cold 10 and electricity 10, in addition to all of the defensive abilities granted by the undead type. A vampire also gains fast healing 5. If reduced to 0 hit points in combat, a vampire assumes gaseous form (see below) and attempts to escape. It must reach its coffin home within 2 hours or be utterly destroyed. (It can normally travel up to 9 miles in 2 hours.) Additional damage dealt to a vampire forced into gaseous form has no effect. Once at rest, the vampire is helpless. It regains 1 hit point after 1 hour, then is no longer helpless and resumes healing at the rate of 5 hit points per round. Weaknesses: Vampires cannot tolerate the strong odor of garlic and will not enter an area laced with it. Similarly, they recoil from mirrors or strongly presented holy symbols. These things don't harm the vampire-they merely keep it at bay. A recoiling vampire must stay at least 5 feet away from the mirror or holy symbol and cannot touch or make melee attacks against that creature. Holding a vampire at bay takes a standard action. After 1 round, a vampire can overcome its revulsion of the object and function normally each round it makes a DC 25 Will save. Vampires cannot enter a private home or dwelling unless invited in by someone with the authority to do so. Reducing a vampire's hit points to 0 or lower incapacitates it but doesn't always destroy it (see fast healing). However, certain attacks can slay vampires. Exposing any vampire to direct sunlight staggers it on the first round of exposure and destroys it utterly on the second consecutive round of exposure if it does not escape. Each round of immersion in running water inf licts damage on a vampire equal to onethird of its maximum hit points-a vampire reduced to 0 hit points in this manner is destroyed. Driving a wooden stake through a helpless vampire's heart instantly slays it (this is a full-round action). However, it returns to life if the stake is removed, unless the head is also severed and anointed with holy water. Speed: Same as the base creature. If the base creature has a swim speed, the vampire is not unduly harmed by running water. Melee: A vampire gains a slam attack if the base creature didn't have one. Damage for the slam depends on the vampire's size (see pages 301-302). Its slam also causes energy drain (see below). Its natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Special Attacks: A vampire gains several special attacks. Save DCs are equal to 10 + 1/2 vampire's HD + vampire's Cha modifier unless otherwise noted. Blood Drain (Su): A vampire can suck blood from a grappled opponent; if the vampire establishes or maintains a pin, it drains blood, dealing 1d4 points of Constitution damage. The vampire heals 5 hit points or gains 5 temporary hit points for 1 hour (up to a maximum number of temporary hit points equal to its full normal hit points) each round it drains blood. Children of the Night (Su): Once per day, a vampire can call forth 1d6+1 rat swarms, 1d4+1 bat swarms, or 2d6 wolves as a standard action. (If the base creature is not terrestrial, this power might summon other creatures of similar power.) These creatures arrive in 2d6 rounds and serve the vampire for up to 1 hour. Create Spawn (Su): A vampire can create spawn out of those it slays with blood drain or energy drain, provided that the slain creature is of the same creature type as the vampire's base creature type. The victim rises from death as a vampire in 1d4 days. This vampire is under the command of the vampire that created it, and remains enslaved until its master's destruction. A vampire may have enslaved spawn totaling no more than twice its own Hit Dice; any spawn it creates that would exceed this limit become free-willed undead. A vampire may free an enslaved spawn in order to enslave a new spawn, but once freed, a vampire or vampire spawn cannot be enslaved again. Dominate (Su): A vampire can crush a humanoid opponent's will as a standard action. Anyone the vampire targets must succeed on a Will save or fall instantly under the vampire's inf luence, as though by a dominate person spell (caster level 12th). The ability has a range of 30 feet. At the GM's discretion, some vampires might be able to affect different creature types with this power. Energy Drain (Su): A creature hit by a vampire's slam (or other natural weapon) gains two negative levels. This ability only triggers once per round, regardless of the number of attacks a vampire makes. Special Qualities: A vampire gains the following. Change Shape (Su): A vampire can use change shape to assume the form of a dire bat or wolf, as beast shape II. Gaseous Form (Su): As a standard action, a vampire can assume gaseous form at will (caster level 5th), but it can remain gaseous indefinitely and has a fly speed of 20 feet with perfect maneuverability. Shadowless (Ex): A vampire casts no shadows and shows no ref lection in a mirror. Spider Climb (Ex): A vampire can climb sheer surfaces as though under the effects of a spider climb spell. Ability Scores Str +6, Dex +4, Int +2, Wis +2, Cha +4. As an undead creature, a vampire has no Constitution score. Skills Vampires gain a +8 racial bonus on Bluff, Perception, Sense Motive, and Stealth checks. Feats Vampires gain Alertness, Combat Ref lexes, Dodge, Improved Initiative, Lightning Ref lexes, and Toughness as bonus feats. Vampire Spawn A vampire can elect to create a vampire spawn instead of a full-f ledged vampire when she uses her create spawn ability on a humanoid creature only. This decision must be made as a free action whenever a vampire slays an appropriate creature by using blood drain or energy drain. A vampire spawn's statistics are identical to those of a wight, save for the following changes. ΓÇó It gains the blood drain and dominate vampire special attacks.

They look much as they did in life, often becoming more attractive, though some have a hardened, feral look instead.</p><p><b>Creating a Vampire</b><br> ""Vampire"" is an acquired template that can be added to any living creature with 5 or more Hit Dice (referred to hereafter as the base creature). Most vampires were once humanoids, fey, or monstrous humanoids. A vampire uses the base creature's stats and abilities except as noted here.</p><p><b>CR:</b> Same as the base creature + 2.</p><p><b>AL:</b> Any evil.</p><p><b>Type:</b> The creature's type changes to undead (augmented).</p><p>Do not recalculate class Hit Dice, BAB, or saves.</p><p><b>Senses:</b> A vampire gains darkvision 60 ft.</p><p><b>Armor Class:</b> Natural armor improves by +6.</p><p><b>Hit Dice:</b> Change all racial Hit Dice to d8s. Class Hit Dice are unaffected. As undead, vampires use their Charisma modifier to determine bonus hit points (instead of Constitution).</p><p><b>Defensive Abilities:</b> A vampire gains channel resistance +4, DR 10/magic and silver, and resistance to cold 10 and electricity 10, in addition to all of the defensive abilities granted by the undead type. A vampire also gains fast healing 5. If reduced to 0 hit points in combat, a vampire assumes gaseous form (see below) and attempts to escape.</p><p>It must reach its coffin home within 2 hours or be utterly destroyed. (It can normally travel up to 9 miles in 2 hours.) Additional damage dealt to a vampire forced into gaseous form has no effect. Once at rest, the vampire is helpless. It regains 1 hit point after 1 hour, then is no longer helpless and resumes healing at the rate of 5 hit points per round.</p><p><b>Weaknesses:</b> Vampires cannot tolerate the strong odor of garlic and will not enter an area laced with it. Similarly, they recoil from mirrors or strongly presented holy symbols.</p><p>These things don't harm the vampire-they merely keep it at bay. A recoiling vampire must stay at least 5 feet away from the mirror or holy symbol and cannot touch or make melee attacks against that creature. Holding a vampire at bay takes a standard action. After 1 round, a vampire can overcome its revulsion of the object and function normally each round it makes a DC 25 Will save.</p><p>Vampires cannot enter a private home or dwelling unless invited in by someone with the authority to do so.</p><p>Reducing a vampire's hit points to 0 or lower incapacitates it but doesn't always destroy it (see fast healing). However, certain attacks can slay vampires. Exposing any vampire to direct sunlight staggers it on the first round of exposure and destroys it utterly on the second consecutive round of exposure if it does not escape. Each round of immersion in running water inf licts damage on a vampire equal to onethird of its maximum hit points-a vampire reduced to 0 hit points in this manner is destroyed. Driving a wooden stake through a helpless vampire's heart instantly slays it (this is a full-round action). However, it returns to life if the stake is removed, unless the head is also severed and anointed with holy water.</p><p><b>Speed: </b>Same as the base creature. If the base creature has a swim speed, the vampire is not unduly harmed by running water.</p><p><b>Melee:</b> A vampire gains a slam attack if the base creature didn't have one. Damage for the slam depends on the vampire's size (see pages 301-302). Its slam also causes energy drain (see below). Its natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p><p><b>Special Attacks:</b> A vampire gains several special attacks.</p><p>Save DCs are equal to 10 + 1/2 vampire's HD + vampire's Cha modifier unless otherwise noted.</p><p><i>Blood Drain (Su):</i> A vampire can suck blood from a grappled opponent; if the vampire establishes or maintains a pin, it drains blood, dealing 1d4 points of Constitution damage. The vampire heals 5 hit points or gains 5 temporary hit points for 1 hour (up to a maximum number of temporary hit points equal to its full normal hit points) each round it drains blood.</p><p><i>Children of the Night (Su):</i> Once per day, a vampire can call forth 1d6+1 rat swarms, 1d4+1 bat swarms, or 2d6 wolves as a standard action. (If the base creature is not terrestrial, this power might summon other creatures of similar power.) These creatures arrive in 2d6 rounds and serve the vampire for up to 1 hour.</p><p><i>Create Spawn (Su):</i> A vampire can create spawn out of those it slays with blood drain or energy drain, provided that the slain creature is of the same creature type as the vampire's base creature type. The victim rises from death as a vampire in 1d4 days. This vampire is under the command of the vampire that created it, and remains enslaved until its master's destruction. A vampire may have enslaved spawn totaling no more than twice its own Hit Dice; any spawn it creates that would exceed this limit become free-willed undead.</p><p>A vampire may free an enslaved spawn in order to enslave a new spawn, but once freed, a vampire or vampire spawn cannot be enslaved again.</p><p><i>Dominate (Su):</i> A vampire can crush a humanoid opponent's will as a standard action. Anyone the vampire targets must succeed on a Will save or fall instantly under the vampire's inf luence, as though by a dominate person spell (caster level 12th). The ability has a range of 30 feet. At the GM's discretion, some vampires might be able to affect different creature types with this power.</p><p><i>Energy Drain (Su):</i> A creature hit by a vampire's slam (or other natural weapon) gains two negative levels. This ability only triggers once per round, regardless of the number of attacks a vampire makes.</p><p>Special Qualities: A vampire gains the following.</p><p><i>Change Shape (Su):</i> A vampire can use change shape to assume the form of a dire bat or wolf, as beast shape II.</p><p><i>Gaseous Form (Su):</i> As a standard action, a vampire can assume gaseous form at will (caster level 5th), but it can remain gaseous indefinitely and has a fly speed of 20 feet with perfect maneuverability.</p><p><i>Shadowless (Ex):</i> A vampire casts no shadows and shows no ref lection in a mirror.</p><p><i>Spider Climb (Ex):</i> A vampire can climb sheer surfaces as though under the effects of a spider climb spell.</p><p><b>Ability Scores:</b> Str +6, Dex +4, Int +2, Wis +2, Cha +4. As an undead creature, a vampire has no Constitution score.</p><p><b>Skills:</b> Vampires gain a +8 racial bonus on Bluff, Perception, Sense Motive, and Stealth checks.</p><p><b>Feats:</b> Vampires gain Alertness, Combat Ref lexes, Dodge, Improved Initiative, Lightning Ref lexes, and Toughness as bonus feats.</p><p><b>Vampire Spawn</b><br> A vampire can elect to create a vampire spawn instead of a full-fledged vampire when she uses her create spawn ability on a humanoid creature only. This decision must be made as a free action whenever a vampire slays an appropriate creature by using blood drain or energy drain. A vampire spawn's statistics are identical to those of a wight, save for the following changes.</p><p> <ul> <li> It gains the blood drain and dominate vampire special attacks.</p><p><li> It gains channel resistance +2, DR 5/silver, resist cold and energy 10, fast healing 2, and the vampire qualities listed above (gaseous form, shadowless, and spider climb).</p><p><li> A vampire spawn gains all of the standard vampire weaknesses.</p><p><li> A vampire spawn is CR 4. </ul> </p></h4></div>",Female,undead,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,NULL,NULL,NULL

A kissed opponent must succeed on a DC 16 Fortitude save or begin a terrible transformation that changes the creature into a vargouille within 24 hours (and often much sooner; roll 1d6 separately for each phase of the transformation). First, over a period of 1d6 hours, all the victim's hair falls out. Within another 1d6 hours thereafter, the ears grow into leathery wings, tentacles sprout on the chin and scalp, and the teeth become long, pointed fangs. During the next 1d6 hours, the victim takes Intelligence drain and Charisma drain equal to 1 point per hour (to a minimum of 3). The transformation is complete 1d6 hours thereafter, when the victim's head breaks free of the body (which promptly dies) and becomes a vargouille. This transformation's progress is paused by sunlight or any light spell of 3rd level or higher, but stopping the transformation requires remove disease or a similar effect. The transformation is a disease effect. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +4 racial bonus.

The save DC is Constitution-based.  Shriek (Su) Instead of biting, a vargouille can open its distended mouth to shriek. Those within 60 feet (except other vargouilles) who hear the shriek and can clearly see the creature must succeed on a DC 12 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 2d4 rounds or until the monster attacks them, goes out of range, or leaves their sight. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same vargouille's shriek for 24 hours.  The save DC is Constitution-based.","A vargouille is larger than a human head, typically between 12 and 20 inches high with a 15- to 35-inch wing span. Vargouilles are not natives of the Material Plane but can often be found there nevertheless, occupying graveyards, ancient battlefields, or anywhere one can find remnants of death and decay.  These hideous monsters come from the fiendish outer planes, where they flop and flap through strange and haunted skies in constant search of fresh souls to torment. In these nightmare realms, vargouilles play a role similar to that of a raven or vulture, although they augment these roles with a malevolent delight in causing pain and anguish that no scavenger bird could ever hope to match.  Vargouilles attack by swooping in on their opponents, shrieking them into paralysis, and then biting them with rows of razor-sharp teeth. When multiple vargouilles take up a common cause and fight as allies, they overwhelm their victim with bites and shrieks, tearing it to shreds.  A vargouille's low power and hideous method of reproduction make for a dangerous combination.  Vargouilles are relatively easy to summon to the Material Plane, and once here, they can swiftly reproduce, creating more and more of their hideous kind from those who fall victim to their kiss. Vargouilles created on the Material Plane in this manner are still extraplanar creatures, and as such can be banished with the right magic.","<link rel=""stylesheet""href=""PF.css""><div><h2>Vargouille</h2><h3><i>This creature is a blackened, bat-winged fiend's head.

Often, a vegepygmy uses such bones to craft a crude spear or some other weapon. Vegepygmy tribes live in tightly knit communities and fiercely guard their patches of russet mold. Vegepygmies cannot speak-they communicate via a crude language of rhythmic taps, beats, and clicks. Hunting parties echo these exchanges through the caves they travel. Vegepygmies stand 2 to 4 feet tall and weigh between 15 to 45 pounds. Approximately 1 in 20 vegepymies are chieftains. A vegepygmy chieftain is an advanced vegepygmy (often one with class levels) that carries an infestation of russet mold spores in its flesh.

Russet Mold (CR 6) This hazardous fungus can be found in dark, wet areas, and often grows in great abundance at the heart of a vegepygmy lair.

A new Fortitude save can be attempted each round to halt the growth. Although immunity to disease won't protect against russet mold spores, the growth can be halted by remove disease and similar effects. Exposure to sunlight also halts the spores' growth. Plants are immune to russet mold spores. After 24 hours, a fully grown vegepygmy bursts from the body of any creature slain by russet mold, provided the creature was Small or larger. For each size category larger than Small, the body produces one additional vegepygmy. A patch of russet mold is unharmed by all effects save for acid, alcohol, or remove disease (or a similar magical effect, such as heal), all of which can kill a single patch of russet mold on contact.

A traveler can often see signs of the violet fungus in those who dwell or hunt in places where these carnivorous fungi lurk. In these folk, deep and hideous scars mar bodies where entire furrows of flesh seem scooped away-the marks of a close encounter with a violet fungus. A violet fungus feeds on the rot and decay of organic matter, but unlike most fungi, they are not passive consumers of corruption. A violet fungi's tendrils can strike with unexpected swiftness, and are coated with a virulent venom that causes flesh to rot and decay with nauseating speed. This potent poison, if left untreated, can cause the flesh of an entire arm or leg to drop away in no time at all, leaving behind only warm bones that soon rot into corruption as well. Although violet fungi are mobile, they only move to attack or to hunt for prey. A violet fungus that has a steady supply of rot to sup upon is generally content to remain in one place. Many underground-dwelling cultures take advantage of this penchant, particularly troglodytes and vegepygmies, and keep multiple violet fungi in key junctions and entrances to their caverns as guardians, making sure to keep them well fed with carrion to prevent them wandering farther into the den in search of food. Some species of shriekers (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 416) are relatively similar in appearance to violet fungi, although they lack the tentacular branches. It's not uncommon to find shriekers and violet fungi growing in the same grove-especially in areas where other creatures cultivate the fungi as guardians. A violet fungus is 4 feet tall and weighs 50 pounds. Violet Venom Although a violet fungus's tentacles swiftly grow inert after the mushroom is slain, they can be wielded as Medium-sized whips for 2d6 minutes after being harvested from the creature. These whips inf lict rot on anything they touch-including the wielder of the deadly weapon-and both save DCs to resist and effects are identical to the stats presented above.

This mastery allows the creature to defend against similar tactics. A vouivre receives a +4 racial bonus on saving throws to resist mind-affecting effects.,"Often mistaken for an offshoot of all manner of bizarre creatures from nagas to lamias, or the hybridized result of magical experimentation, vouivres are a unique race that breeds true. Reclusive and strange creatures, vouivres prey on hapless travelers who stumble upon their choice bathing spots or unfortunate explorers who venture too close to their lairs. A vouivre always appears as an attractive woman from the waist up, but the curve of her hips leads to a thick, reptilian body ending in a dragon's head. While variations exist between individual creatures, a vouivre usually has fair skin and dark hair, at least on its humanoid portion. The draconic half of one of these strange monsters always possesses greenhued scales, gradually shifting from dull olive to radiant emerald shades as the creature ages. A typical vouivre is over 12 feet long from head to head, and weighs about 500 pounds.  Ecology Vouivres make their homes in small caves near slowmoving rivers, placid lakes, and gurgling streams. There they keep their treasured items and frequently bathe in the soothing waters, preying on anyone who strays too close to the water's edge. Vouivres prefer to capture and eat humanoid males, but will feed on any available warmblooded prey when hungry. Rarely, a vouivre selects humanoid females as its primary prey, usually frequent bathers or washerwomen visiting a nearby brook. After devouring a humanoid, a vouivre can forgo a meal for 2 months before needing to feed again.  Vouivres breed in a unique manner. Living as celibates, these creatures reproduce asexually, only producing a new specimen after death. This bizarre process is more akin to a form of cloning than actual reproduction, leading some scholars to conjecture that only a fixed number of these creatures exist in the world simultaneously. After a vouivre dies, its dragon head disgorges a glassy, rubytinted sphere that serves as an egg of sorts. Beginning 1 week after death, this egg begins growing, eventually reaching a diameter of 2 feet, while its gleaming luster dims to a clouded, dull red. After 6 weeks, the gem splits, giving birth to a vouivre hatchling that must find a suitable secluded sanctuary and begin feeding itself from nearby resources.  This immature form remains hidden for years, slithering through obscuring muck and feeding on waterfowl and swimming rodents, until it reaches adult size, fully grown and ready to hunt its favorite prey.  While not a complete replica of its mother, a vouivre inherits traits and characteristics of its parent's meals throughout its lifetime. A vouivre understands this and thus seeks out handsome and formidable targets for its meals, hoping to pass down the best possible traits to its eventual offspring. A vouivre lives for roughly 200 years, barring any violent end, and matures from hatchling to adult in 7 years.  All vouivres have a singular relationship with sound.  As it desires, and especially when slithering seductively toward a victim, a vouivre can vibrate its scales, producing a haunting hum that excites the water around it in a strange, rippling harmony. A vouivre uses this sound as the basis for many of its spell-like abilities, accompanying the effects with song and seductive oratory. When a vouivre grows agitated, this low drone can reach a crescendo of ear-shattering noise, or become an insinuating resonance that turns trusted companions against each other.  Habitat and Society Solitary almost to the point of xenophobia, vouivres rarely meet. These creatures make their lairs far away from one another, and considering their unique style of reproduction, a single lineage can prey upon a particular region for centuries.  Although vouivres live in isolation from other intelligent creatures, they possess an afinity for serpents. Snakes of all kinds find themselves drawn to vouivres, with vipers and constrictors frequently found slithering among the scattered treasure in a vouivre's lair. Those fortunate few who have survived an encounter with a vouivre often report snakes assisting in the attack. Sages speculate that the delicate vibrations produced by a vouivre's scales enchant the serpents into this service.  Vouivres get along well with evil fey living near their lairs and sometimes even go so far as to share trinkets and gems from their hoards in return for mutual protection and companionship. Nefarious nixies, sinister selkies, and other waterborne fey particularly find places within a powerful vouivre's entourage. While they all have their own diverse hunting grounds, these companions meet regularly to share stories and even meals.  Though savage and bestial, vouivres have a love for material items. Gold jewelry, loose coins, finely cut gems, lavish decorations, and fine silks lie about their lairs. Vouivres covet this treasure and arrange the glittering goods in pleasing configurations, whimsically shifting the items around and redecorating as they please. These creatures constantly barter and trade, and demand payment from victims who beg for their lives.  Frequently, vouivres use their treasure as a way to lure unsuspecting travelers close, placing the bait among the reeds near the water's edge to catch the glint of the sun. As victims come to claim their found prize, the vouivre reveals its humanoid half while its dragon head lies unseen in the water below.  Vouivres prefer intelligent humanoids as prey, to hunt, toy with, and eventually eat. Adept at charm, deception, and trickery, vouivres rarely attack their prey directly, instead preferring to engage their victims in conversation before attacking unexpectedly. In combat, a vouivre's dragon head begins by roaring forth with a gout of flame before biting foes. With prey in its mouth, the dragon head can lock its jaws in place, holding a creature fast in its backward-curving teeth as the vouivre swims to deeper waters to drown its victim before bringing it back to its treasure-strewn cave for a satisfying meal.","<link rel=""stylesheet""href=""PF.css""><div><h2>VOUIVRE</h2><h3><i>This bizarre, two-headed monster is a perverse combination of beautiful maiden and menacing dragon, joined by a slithering, snake-like body.

These creatures constantly barter and trade, and demand payment from victims who beg for their lives.</p><p>Frequently, vouivres use their treasure as a way to lure unsuspecting travelers close, placing the bait among the reeds near the water's edge to catch the glint of the sun. As victims come to claim their found prize, the vouivre reveals its humanoid half while its dragon head lies unseen in the water below.</p><p>Vouivres prefer intelligent humanoids as prey, to hunt, toy with, and eventually eat. Adept at charm, deception, and trickery, vouivres rarely attack their prey directly, instead preferring to engage their victims in conversation before attacking unexpectedly. In combat, a vouivre's dragon head begins by roaring forth with a gout of flame before biting foes. With prey in its mouth, the dragon head can lock its jaws in place, holding a creature fast in its backward-curving teeth as the vouivre swims to deeper waters to drown its victim before bringing it back to its treasure-strewn cave for a satisfying meal.</p></h4></div>",NULL,,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,NULL

Bubonic Plague: aura-inhaled; save Fort DC 21; onset 1 day; frequency 1/day; effect 1d4 Con damage and 1 Cha damage and target is fatigued; cure 2 consecutive saves.","A restless and savage form of undead, the vrykolakas knows only rage and relishes the suffering of those who failed it in life. Reanimated corpses of wicked and vengeful souls denied even the basic burial rites, these unreasoning vampire-kin unleash their wrath against the living, indiscriminately spreading disease and death among all in their paths. Their bitterness at their own disgraced ends drives them to a loathing of all life and a jealous desire to see all other living creatures fall to their same level of profanity and debasement. Such hardly proves a conscious plot, though, but rather a fundamental instinct. Thus, a single vrykolakas can devastate an entire village, potentially spawning a host of new vrykolakas from their victims. A vrykolakas (the name both singular and plural) appears as a terrible, bestial corruption of the being it was in life. Twisted by rage and undeath into an animalistic shape, these undead bear the taint of death, their bodies lean to the appearance of starvation and pocked with evidence of rot and disease. Hunched and twisted, a vrykolakas's bent spine is the same length it was in life if straightened, but the feral posture of most cause them to slump to a mere 4-1/2 to 5 feet tall. The wasting of death also greatly decreases the corpse's weight, reducing even hearty men to at least 20 or 30 pounds less than they weighed in life. Ecology Despite its savage and decayed appearance, a vrykolakas often passes through towns and villages undeterred, due to its supernatural ability to disguise itself. With the ability to cloak its terrible shape, a vrykolakas typically appears little different than it did in life. Death removes much of the living corpse's sense of who it was, though, so vrykolakas rarely reconstruct their original appearances with complete accuracy. Thus, family and acquaintances often notice the resemblance, but do not readily identify a vrykolakas as the resurrected individual. A vrykolakas thrives upon disease and death, drawing its vigor from those humanoids it passes near. It walks among the living merely to infect them with its grave taint, passing on the subtle corruption of death. Its mere touch drains the life from a victim as well, stealing from its very essence. A vrykolakas's favored victims typically come from among its former family members and friends, which it pursues with only half a memory of any previous connection, yet a lingering malice, as such former companions failed to prevent its accursed fate. A vrykolakas is uniquely bound to the place where it died or its body was originally interred. It must return to this site every Starday and bury itself amid the earth or stones to rest for 24 hours. A vrykolakas is entirely helpless during this period and can be easily destroyed if it can be located. The vampire-kin understand this weakness, though, and go to great lengths to avoid being followed to their resting places. Habitat & Society Vrykolakas typically appear near or in rural areas close to their graves. They walk the open streets of villages and hamlets during daylight hours, avoiding direct interaction and attention, all the while infecting those nearby and robbing them of their vitality. By night they seek to take their revenge more overtly, wreaking havoc upon the community, destroying food and property, attacking and smothering people in their beds, stealing valuables, and generally terrorizing people. Many rural superstitions and prejudices against strangers stem from tales of vrykolakas, slipping quietly into town or lurking at the edges of a community, spreading death and despair among the innocent. The Greek Vampire The vrykolakas (pronounced ""vree- KO-la-kahss"") is an undead creature from Greek folklore. Synonymous with revenants, these terrors manifest as humans that have returned from the grave to perform some act before they can peacefully rest. Many stories of the vrykolakas are not of horrid, evil undead, but of deceased persons attempting to return to their former lives, such as the shoemaker who returned from the grave to mend his children's shoes, carry water, and chop firewood. The more vengeful type of vrykolakas gained stronger belief in Greece after the arrival of Slavic immigrants, who brought with them tales of blood-drinking vampires and werewolves. The word vrykolakas itself borrows from Slavic, derived from the Bulgarian word vukodlak, vuk meaning ""wolf "" and dlaka meaning ""fur."" This suggests that vrykolakas were somehow associated with werewolves, most likely due to the Slavic belief that werewolves became vampires after they died. A person could become a vrykolakas in a variety of ways. The most common involve a person being evil and immoral, an excommunication from the church, or improper burial rites. Some thought that eating the meat of a sheep that had been killed or wounded by a wolf or a werewolf would turn a person into a vrykolakas. A cat or other animal jumping over a dead body could also result in its evil return. Curses, such as ""may the ground not receive thee,"" would also condemn the recipient to undeath as a vrykolakas. Many also believed that a vrykolakas would knock at your door and call your name, but could only do so once. If one answered the door, he would die shortly thereafter, and become a vrykolakas. For this reason, the superstition that one should not answer the door until the second knock still exists in some Greek villages.","<link rel=""stylesheet""href=""PF.css""><div><h2>Vrykolakas</h2><h3><i>Slinking forth on bent limbs and gnarled claws, this twisted abomination bears a resemblance to a starved, plague-ridden ape, its form bestial and bent, with pallid skin stretched unnaturally over knotted bone.

It can also cross areas covered with deadly impediments (such as caltrops or thorns) without being damaged or hindered. In addition to being entirely immune to fire, the creature's legs are immune to acid and cold, allowing it to cross even rivers of acid or lava without being damaged or hindered as long as the material is less than 4 feet deep. This ability does not protect a levaloch against magical hindrances like black tentacles, web, or similar spells. Merciless Blow (Su) Levalochs show no mercy to the vulnerable.

Stability (Ex) Levalochs receive a +4 racial bonus to their CMD when resisting a bull rush or trip attempt while standing on the ground. Summon Devil (Sp) Once per day a levaloch can attempt to summon 1d4 lemures or 1 bearded devil with a 40% chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of a 4th-level spell.

This Stealth bonus increases to +8 when a levaloch is concealed amid metal objects or debris.","Fearsome giants of steel and blades, levalochs serve within the armies of archdevils and infernal dukes as potent warriors and tenacious hunters, creatures of absolute discipline endlessly obedient to diabolical tyrants. Renowned for their skill on Hell's battlefields, these fearsome soldiers excel in moving swiftly over the broken landscapes that typify the nine layers of the Pit, hunting down intruders and seeking out errant souls wherever they might flee. En masse, the armored clanking of obedient and watchful infantry sound like the workings of great machines as levaloch hosts man Hell's ramparts, from the Iron Fortresses of Avernus to the walls of Ashtart. Levalochs possess consistent forms, each resembling all others of their kind in general shape and size, though each devil's armor proves distinctive. Some claim that the arrangement of a levaloch's spikes, horns, blades, or other iron-shod embellishments might reveal what layer of Hell or infernal noble spawned the devil, though few have the time to ponder such concerns as one of these razor-legged legionaries rages forward. With little variation, levalochs stand just over 10 feet tall and weigh almost exactly 1 ton. Ecology Levalochs blur the line between devil and automaton. While created from the souls of the damned and the profane energies of Hell, these fiends live only to obey their masters and, upon their home plane, seemingly possess little will or ambition beyond such obedience. Requiring no food or rest, a levaloch sentinel might hold its post, completely motionless, for centuries, collecting ages of dust without complaint as it awaits orders that might never come. While intelligent, these devils prove fanatically devoted to the causes of their masters, the archdevils, Asmodeus, and Hell itself, drawing on ingrained wells of discipline and faith to mete out the greater will of their overlords. Levalochs are highly prized throughout the Pit for this discipline, held up as epitomes of diabolical warriors second only to the ferocious cornugons, and pointed to throughout the planes as embodiments of the soldier's ideal. Yet this discipline only persists while levalochs remain under orders from more powerful devils. Left to their own devices, each levaloch fancies itself a tyrant by its own right and relishes the opportunity to promote conf lict and bloodshed through petty mortal angst and grudges. While all devils possess anatomies that perpetually baff le mortal scholars, levalochs prove even more enigmatic, having no internal physiology at all. Being little more than living suits of blasphemous chitin and Hell-forged armor, these fiends lack all weaknesses of even infernal flesh and blood, while retaining all of the potent resistances common to their diabolical kin. A levaloch's sentience seems to linger within its armored shell, remaining until that exoskeleton proves too damaged to contain an animating spirit any longer. Should a levaloch's armor be destroyed, the plates of metal and carapace fall to pieces and quickly corrode, revealing nothing more than the strong scent of pitch within. Despite their unusual anatomy, levalochs are still thinking, even cunning creatures. The fiendish intelligences housed within these ironclad horrors cause some sages to draw frightening parallels between levalochs and the profane soul-bound armors of the infamous undead graveknights. Habitat & Society Commonly found upon the first and sixth layers of Hell and amid the outlying fortresses of Dis, levalochs muster in the service of the Pit's most martial tyrants. Most know only their orders, following their masters' commands to the letter, disregarding all things that fall outside of their purview-at least until such things threaten their masters' holdings or themselves. Intruders within infernal citadels sometimes find themselves unchallenged as they wander vast halls watched over by whole platoons of posted, idle levalochs, only to be attacked unexpectedly upon encountering those specifically commanded to stand sentry. These fiends hold to their orders not out of dull-wittedness, but out of obsessive obedience to the rule of Hell, as proven by their murderous cunning in battle. On the rare occasions levalochs find themselves left to their own devices, the true intellect of these armored terrors becomes apparent. Capable of shocking changes in personality, a levaloch that might not have spoken a word in its entire existence might prove shrewd and subtle when it finds itself upon the Material Plane, stirring old angers, forging Hellish weaponry, even training mortal warriors in a strategic game of warmongering and open campaigning, all encouraging bloodshed in the name of Hell. They despise the weakness of emotion and the changeability of mortal minds. Thus, they delight in testing themselves against mortal flesh, indulging in massacres and encouraging genocides against such weak, worthless creatures whenever their plots might gain even the slightest benefit from such atrocities. Such pride rarely proves the undoing of levalochs, though, as these armored fiends treat every battle as a chance to hone their impressive skills and give foes-regardless of race-no quarter.","<link rel=""stylesheet""href=""PF.css""><div><h2>Devil, Warmonger</h2><h3><i>Armored like an infernal knight upon some monstrous steed, this fiend of iron and nails scuttles upon six heavy, bladed, beetle-like legs.

Water nagas measure 10 feet long and weigh 250 pounds.  Where many nagas claim particular lairs as their homes, water nagas typically have a number of retreats, migrating from one to the next with the seasons.

Spawn so created are less powerful than typical wights, and suffer a -2 penalty on all d20 rolls and checks, as well as -2 hp per HD. Spawn are under the command of the wight that created them and remain enslaved until its death, at which point they lose their spawn penalties and become fullfledged and free-willed wights. They do not possess any of the abilities they had in life. Resurrection Vulnerability (Su) A raise dead or similar spell cast on a wight destroys it (Will negates). Using the spell in this way does not require a material component.","Wights are humanoids who rise as undead due to necromancy, a violent death, or an extremely malevolent personality. In some cases, a wight arises when an evil undead spirit permanently bonds with a corpse, often the corpse of a slain warrior. They are barely recognizable to those who knew them in life; their flesh is twisted by evil and undeath, the eyes burn with hatred, and the teeth become beast-like. In some ways, a wight bridges the gap between a ghoul and a spectre-a warped animated corpse whose touch steals living energy. As undead, wights do not need to breathe, so they are sometimes found underwater, though they are not particularly good swimmers unless they were originally swimming creatures such as aquatic elves or merfolk. Underwater wights prefer low-ceilinged caves where their limited swimming isn't as much of a liability. The wight presented here is a typical example of its kind, but sometimes when a wight creates spawn from particularly unusual humanoids, the resulting wights are quite different in power, such as the following three variants. Brute Wight (CR 5): Giants that are killed by wights become hunchbacked, simple-minded undead. Brute wights are giant advanced wights, but cannot create spawn of their own. Cairn Wight (CR 4): Some societies deliberately create these specialized wights to serve as guardians for barrows or other burial sites. A cairn wight is an advanced wight that fights with a weapon, typically a sword, that channels its energy drain attack and affects creatures damaged by the weapon as if they had been struck by the wight's slam attack.

Spawn are under the command of the wight that created them and remain enslaved until its death, at which point they lose their spawn penalties and become fullfledged and free-willed wights.

In some cases, a wight arises when an evil undead spirit permanently bonds with a corpse, often the corpse of a slain warrior. They are barely recognizable to those who knew them in life; their flesh is twisted by evil and undeath, the eyes burn with hatred, and the teeth become beast-like. In some ways, a wight bridges the gap between a ghoul and a spectre-a warped animated corpse whose touch steals living energy.</p><p>As undead, wights do not need to breathe, so they are sometimes found underwater, though they are not particularly good swimmers unless they were originally swimming creatures such as aquatic elves or merfolk.</p><p>Underwater wights prefer low-ceilinged caves where their limited swimming isn't as much of a liability.</p><p>The wight presented here is a typical example of its kind, but sometimes when a wight creates spawn from particularly unusual humanoids, the resulting wights are quite different in power, such as the following three variants.</p><p><b>Brute Wight (CR 5):</b> Giants that are killed by wights become hunchbacked, simple-minded undead. Brute wights are giant advanced wights, but cannot create spawn of their own.</p><p><b>Cairn Wight (CR 4):</b> Some societies deliberately create these specialized wights to serve as guardians for barrows or other burial sites. A cairn wight is an advanced wight that fights with a weapon, typically a sword, that channels its energy drain attack and affects creatures damaged by the weapon as if they had been struck by the wight's slam attack.</p><p><b>Frost Wight (CR 4):</b> Wights created in cold environments sometimes become pale undead with blue-white eyes and ice in their hair.

In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below. <br> Warp wood or wood shape slows a wood golem (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds (no save). <br> Repel wood drives the golem back 60 feet and deals 2d12 points of damage to it (no save). <br> A magical attack that deals cold damage breaks any slow effect on the golem and heals 1 point of damage for every 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. A wood golem gets no saving throw against attacks that deal cold damage. </h5><h5><b>Splintering (Su)</b> As a free action once every 1d4+1 rounds, a wood golem can launch a barrage of razor-sharp wooden splinters from its body in a 20-foot-radius burst. All creatures caught within this area take 6d6 points of slashing damage (Reflex DC 14 halves).

They are always aggressive and impatient, and are quick to resort to force in order to accomplish their goals. For this reason, dragons generally look down upon wyverns, considering their distant cousins nothing more than primitive savages with a distinct lack of style or wit. In most cases, this generalization is spot-on. Although far from animalistic in intellect, and capable of speech, most wyverns simply can't be bothered with the subtlety of diplomacy, and prefer to fight first and parley later, and even then only if faced with a foe they can neither defeat nor flee from.

Thick scales the color of molten rock cover its long body.,Chromatic Dragon,PFRPG Bestiary,0,"Fire Aura (Su) An adult red dragon is surrounded by an aura of intense heat. All creatures within 5 feet take 1d6 points of fire damage at the beginning of the dragon's turn. An old dragon's aura extends to 10 feet. An ancient dragon's damage increases to 2d6. Incinerate (Su) A great wyrm red dragon can incinerate creatures in its fiery breath. A creature reduced to fewer than 0 hit points by its breath weapon must make a Fortitude save (using the breath weapon's DC). Failure indicates that the creature is reduced to ash. Creatures destroyed in this way can only be restored to life through true resurrection or similar magic. Manipulate Flames (Su) An old or older red dragon can control any fire spell within 10 feet per age category of the dragon as a standard action. This ability allows it to move any fire effect in the area, as if it were the caster. This ability also allows it to reposition a stationary fire effect, although the new placement must be one allowed by the spell. Finally, for 1 round following the use of this ability, the dragon can control any new fire spell cast within its area of control, as if it were the caster. It can make all decisions allowed to the caster, including canceling the spell if it so desires. Melt Stone (Su) An ancient or older red dragon can use its breath weapon to melt rock at a range of 100 feet, affecting a 5-foot-radius area per age category. The area becomes lava to a depth of 1 foot.

An old dragon's aura extends to 10 feet. An ancient dragon's damage increases to 2d6. Freezing Fog (Sp) An old white dragon can use this ability three times per day. It is similar to an acid fog spell but deals cold damage instead of acid damage. It also causes a rime of slippery ice to form on any surface the fog touches, creating the effect of a grease spell. The dragon is immune to the grease effect because of its icewalking ability. This ability is the equivalent of a 6th-level spell. Ice Shape (Su) A young white dragon can shape ice and snow at will. This ability functions as stone shape, but only targeting ice and snow, not stone. A white dragon's caster level for this effect is equal to its Hit Dice.
